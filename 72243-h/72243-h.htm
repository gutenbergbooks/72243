<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noindent center">——◆——</p>

<p class="drop-cap p1">THESE “Bits from Blinkbonny” were grouped
together by the Author to beguile the tedium of
a protracted period of domestic quarantine. They are
not only his first attempt at sustained literary work,
but they were commenced without any concerted plan.</p>

<p>Blinkbonny was selected as a pretty name for a
Scottish village, but the Author himself cannot fix the
precise locality; and all the names he has used are
supposititious, excepting those of such public characters
as Dr. Duff, Dr. Guthrie, etc.</p>

<p>Owing to his having adopted the autobiographical
form, the Author has experienced more difficulty in
writing the preface than any other part of the book,
as, although most of the incidents are founded on fact,
a good deal of imported matter has been required to
form a connected narrative. He also knows that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
bringing together the varieties of character and incident
that an ordinary Scotch village affords, he has
passed “from grave to gay, from lively to severe,” in
some instances with injudicious abruptness, and that
there are other defects for which he needs to apologize;
but as even his readers will probably differ as to where
these occur, it is not desirable for him to dwell on
them.</p>

<p>The Author is not in any way connected with the
Free Church of Scotland, and at the outset he had no
intention of treating so largely as he has done of the
“Disruption” of 1843; if, however, he induces the
rising generation to study the past and the present of
that great movement, neither they nor he will regret
the prominence given to it in this volume.</p>

<p>The illustrations with which the book is embellished
are “composition” sketches; but the Author confidently
leaves these to introduce themselves.</p>

<p>The idiom of the Scottish language—the dear old
Doric—has been to the Author a difficult matter to
render, so as to be at once intelligible to ordinary
readers and fairly representative of the everyday
mother tongue of the common people of Scotland.
He hopes that he has succeeded in doing this, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
as in preserving a few of the floating traditions of the
passing generation which are so rapidly being swept
away by the absorbing whirlpool of these bustling
times, and that his readers will follow with kindly
interest these homely records of the various subjects
he has tried to portray in these “Bits from Blinkbonny.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap-a">AN eminent artist, a member of the Royal Scottish
Academy, who, although well up in the seventies,
and feeling many of the infirmities of advanced age,
still continues to enrich the world by as charming
landscapes and crisp sea-pieces as he produced in his
younger days, was showing me some of his sketches
from nature, many of them bearing traces of repeated
handling. His face brightened up when a well-thumbed
favourite was lighted on amongst the promiscuous
contents of the old portfolio. With his eye
fixed on the sketch, and his hand moving as if either
the pencil or the brush were in it, he told with animation
where he made this sketch or took that “bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ARTIST AND HIS “BITS.”</i></div>

<p>“Ah!” said he, “painting is a difficult, a very
difficult thing; in fact, it’s just made up of ‘<i>bits</i>’—just
bits. A something takes your eye,—a nook, a clump
of trees, often a single tree, a boulder, or rocks (grand
effects of light and shade on rocks)—ay, even the
shape or tinge of a cloud. Well, to work you go, and
down with it.—There,” said he, as he lifted what
seemed a mere scrawl on a half-sheet of old note-paper,
“I took that at the Bank door. I was struck
with the effect of the sunlight on water falling over a
barrel that a man was filling in the river, and thought
it would make a nice picture. I got that bit of paper
out of the Bank, took off my hat, laid the paper on it,
sketched it off in—oh! less than five minutes, and
put it on canvas next day. There’s another. I did
that bit on the leaf of my fishing pocket-book at
Makumrich, near old Gilston Castle. Now there,”
said he, taking up a rough-looking, unfinished sea-scene
in oil, “that has been a very useful bit. I
was sketching North Berwick Harbour, when all at
once I was struck with an effect of light and shade on
the sea. I was able to hit it exactly;” and as he said
this, he moved his head from side to side and scanned
the picture, saying, “That bit has been of great use
to me, although I have never made a finished picture
of it. The ‘effect,’ the gleam, the tone are as nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
perfect as possible. Ah,” continued he, laying down
the sketch, and turning to his easel, on which lay a
snow scene,—an old thatched cottage, in my opinion
quite finished,—“now there’s lots of bits to work
up in that picture.” And sometimes shaking his
brush, and sometimes whirling it in a very small
circle close to the picture, but never touching it, he
said, “There—and there—and perhaps there. Ah!
nobody would believe what a labour it is to make a
good picture, with all the <i>bits</i> and <i>bits</i>!”</p>

<p>I am but an aspirant in literature, and would never
presume to compare myself with the veteran artist, or
think that I could ever arrange my bits of village
gossip and incident with the artistic skill which has
earned for him the order of merit that he has so
honourably won and so worthily wears, but I confess
to a desire to present some of the bits of the everyday
social life of Blinkbonny in such a form as to give my
readers an idea of its lights and shadows.</p>

<p>Blinkbonny is more of a village than a town,
although it is generally spoken of by the outside world
as a town, owing to its having its small weekly market
and occasional fairs. It lies fully thirty miles inland
from Edinburgh, and is the centre of a good agricultural
district, with a background of moorland and hills.
My father was a merchant in it,—a very general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
merchant, as he dealt in grain, wool, seeds, groceries,
cloth, hardware, and various other commodities. This
may seem a strange mixture in these days of the
division of labour and subdivision of trades, but such
dealers were not uncommon fifty years ago, and they
were frequently men of considerable capital and influence.
My elder and only brother was a partner with
my father in the business; and as I had early expressed
a desire to be a minister, I was sent to Edinburgh to
prosecute my studies in that direction, and had completed
my fourth session at college, when the death of
my brother rendered it necessary that I should do all
in my power to supply his place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FOLKS AT GREENKNOWE.</i></div>

<p>I had been but a few months at home, when my father,
whose health had been failing for some years, became
a confirmed invalid. My brother’s death had not only
affected his spirits, but injured his health, and within
little more than a year after this heavy trial the old
man was laid beside his wife and eldest son in the
churchyard of Blinkbonny. My sisters, all of them
older than myself, were married, excepting Maggie; and
about a year after my father’s death Maggie became
Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Lauchlan, so that I was left a very young
inmate of Bachelor Hall. When I had time to feel
lonely I did so, but the demands of business kept me
thoroughly employed; and although I joined habitually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
in the socialities of the neighbourhood, I did not
seriously think of getting married until I was called
on to act as bridegroom’s man to my schoolfellow
and college companion, John M<sup>c</sup>Nab, now the Reverend
John M<sup>c</sup>Nab. He married Mary Stewart of Greenknowe,
the daughter of a small proprietor on the outskirts of
our village. Her sister Agnes was bridesmaid, and we
were necessarily brought a good deal into one another’s
society. I had often met her before, and liked her in
a general way, but at her sister’s marriage I came
fully under the influence of her charms. There was
something—well, something—I cannot describe it by
any other word than just “something”—that fairly
possessed me. For days afterwards she was in my head,
in my dreams, in my heart. I will not describe our
courtship; it was neither long nor romantic. I wooed
and won her, got Mrs. Stewart’s consent, and on New
Year’s Day 1841 we fixed that our marriage should
take place in the last week of January.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart felt the cold weather severely, and
could not venture to call at the manse to request
Mr. Barrie, our worthy parish minister, to perform the
ceremony. She asked Agnes to go in her stead, but
Agnes could not muster courage to do so—she even
felt too shy to write to Mr. Barrie; so, although it was
not exactly according to the strict rules of etiquette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
I promised to call on Mr. Barrie next day, and to
arrange the matter with him.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>The manse stood on the top of a piece of slightly
rising ground, about a quarter of a mile to the south-west
of the village. The situation was a pleasant
one. It commanded on three sides extensive views
of a well-cultivated country, backed by high and
picturesque hills; the village bounded the view on the
north-east. Near the manse stood the neat church,
surrounded by the churchyard. There were also a park
of about four acres, a garden covering nearly an acre,
and some outhouses, the whole enclosed by a compact
wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INTERRUPTED CALL.</i></div>

<p>I had been on intimate terms with all the inmates
of the manse, from Bell, the only and worthy servant,
upwards; but my errand made me feel rather confused,
and instead of the usual off-hand remark to Bell, varying
from, “Weel, Bell, hoo’s a’ wi’ ye?” to comments on
the weather or crops, as suited the season, I bluntly
asked if Mr. Barrie was engaged. There was a flavour
of tartness in Bell’s manner as she replied, “Mr.
Barrie’s aye thrang, but he’s aye ready to see onybody
that wants him partic’larly. I’ll speir at <i>him</i> if he’s
engaged,” and she disappeared. Mr. Barrie himself
came to the door, shook hands with me with more
than usual heartiness, put a special emphasis on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span><i>happy</i> in wishing me “a happy New Year,” gave my
hand a sort of squeeze, took a long look at me, and
with a smirk on his face said, “Come in, Mr. Martin,
come in.” He had not called me “Mr.” before, but
only plain Robert; and from the blithe way in which
he showed me into the “study,” I saw that he knew
my position, if not my errand.</p>

<p>Our conversation was at first general, and on my
side jerky. I did not follow up intelligently the
subjects he introduced, but was either silent or
rambling on quite irrelevant topics. He made a long
pause, doubtless to induce me to lead, as he evidently
saw I was not able to follow. The not uncommon
weakness of Scotchmen, of trying to conceal strong
emotions even on subjects on which they feel very
keenly, was working in me. I was heart-glad at the
prospect of my marriage, and well I might; but I
wished to appear very cool, so, as if merely beginning
another subject, I said in a conversational way, “I
was once thinking of getting married.” Scarcely had
I finished the sentence, when Bell announced that Sir
John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland would like to speak to Mr. Barrie
when he was disengaged. Knowing that Sir John was
the largest landowner in the parish, and the patron of
the church, and that he was taking an active part in
a church extension scheme in which Mr. Barrie was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
deeply interested, I at once left the “study,” stating
that I would call to-morrow night, and made for
Greenknowe, where I was bantered by both ladies, but
especially by Mrs. Stewart, when I told about “once
thinking of getting married.”</p>

<p>Laying the emphasis first on the <i>once</i>, then on the
<i>thinking</i>, then on both, she said, “Is that all the length
you are? You should think <i>twice</i>—second thoughts
are often best. Agnes, if you had either called or
written as I wished, we could have had the invitations
out to-day; but perhaps Robert will take the second
thought to-night, and until <i>he</i> quite makes up his mind
we must wait with patience.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEXT VISIT TO THE MANSE.</i></div>

<p>Next night found me at the manse door, which Bell
“answered.” I was very frank, but Bell had barely
digested last night’s slight, and before I had finished
my salutation to her she said dryly, “It’ll be the
minister ye want the nicht again?” and showed me into
the study. Mr. Barrie, after expressing regret at the
sudden breaking up of our last night’s interview, asked
me if the day had been fixed. I told him that we
would prefer the last Tuesday of January, if that date
suited him. He at once said, “I’ll make it suit me;”
and after noting it in a memorandum book, he proceeded,
although I had not mentioned the name of my
future wife, to speak very nicely of the good folks at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Greenknowe; of the late Mr. Stewart, who had been
one of his elders, and from whom, in the earlier years
of his ministry, he had received much useful counsel;
of Mrs. Stewart’s almost motherly kindness ever since
he came to the parish; of his great esteem for
Miss Stewart (my Agnes), and of her devotion to her
father, especially in his long and last illness. He
also spoke of my late father and brother as excellent,
very excellent men, said some things about myself
which I will not repeat, and taking me by the hand,
said, “Humanly speaking, your marriage promises to
be in every respect a happy event for all concerned.
May God bless you both, and make you blessings to
one another, to all your circle, to the Church, and to
the world.”</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly, and added that I might
trouble him by asking his advice on some matters,
and possibly Mrs. Barrie’s; and was proceeding to bid
him good-night, when he said, “Robert, this is an
occasion, I may say a great occasion, and you must
take an egg with us. I told Mrs. Barrie last night
that you were ‘once thinking of getting married.’ She
will be delighted to learn that your second thought
has got the length of fixing the day. And, whilst I
am in the habit of giving all young bridegrooms a few
quiet hints, I would like you to have a chat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
both of us. You will find Mrs. Barrie’s counsel sound
and practical, so we’ll join her in the parlour;” and
suiting the action to the word, he lifted the lamp, and
asking me to follow him, made for the snug parlour,
where he announced me as “a subject of <i>compound</i>
interest now, not simple as before.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie was carefully darning a stocking, which she
laid on the table as I entered, and shaking my hand
with great heartiness, she said, “I need hardly wish <i>you</i>
a happy new year, Mr. Martin. You are as sure to be
happy as anybody can be sure of happiness in this world.
I hope you consider yourself a <i>very</i> lucky man?”</p>

<p>I made as nice a reply as I could. Mrs. Barrie repeated
her husband’s “You must take an egg with us;” and
laying the half-darned stocking into her work-basket
on the back table, she looked into a cradle that stood
in the cosiest corner of the room, and seeing that all
was right there, she said, “I must see that the other
little folks are <i>happit</i> before I sit down,” and left the
room. But before I tell of the evening’s quiet enjoyment
in the manse parlour, I will say something about
the inmates of the manse itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INMATES OF THE MANSE.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Barrie was ordained as minister of Blinkbonny
in 1830, and early in 1831 he brought his young
wife, till then Mary Gordon, home to the manse. He
was a son of the manse, a son of the minimum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
stipend; when half through his preparatory studies he
became a son of the Widows’ Fund. Mrs. Barrie’s
parents had been in a very comfortable worldly
position for the first sixteen years of her life, but
through circumstances over which they had no control,
and to which she never referred, their means
had been greatly reduced. Her father died when she
was eighteen years of age; her mother survived her
father about four years. She was thus an orphan at
twenty-two. She was twenty-five years of age when
she was married, Mr. Barrie being her senior by
fully one year; and whilst she brought to the manse
“a good providing,” she brought little money or
“tocher,” as a bride’s marriage portion is called in
Scotland. The income of the minister of Blinkbonny,
or, to use the church phrase, the “stipend,” was
paid partly in money and partly in grain, and
averaged about £160 yearly. The furnishing of
the manse and the minister’s library had required
and received careful consideration. Even the providing
of live stock for the park, to commence with,
involved an outlay that in the circumstances was
considerable; but by Bell’s indefatigable industry
and management, the cow, the hens, the garden, and
even the pig became such important sources of supply
in the household economy, that any description of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
inmates of the manse would be utterly incomplete which
did not make honourable mention of worthy Bell.</p>

<p>Bell had come with Mrs. Barrie as her first servant,
and had grown up as, if not into, a part of the family.
She was fully the middle height, muscular, not stout
but well-conditioned, had a good complexion, a “weel-faured”
face, keen, deep-set, dark eyes; and altogether
she was a comely woman. I believe her full name
was Isabella Cameron, but she was only known as
Bell, occasionally Mr. Barrie’s Bell; so much so that
when a letter came to the manse, addressed “Miss
Cameron,” both Mr. and Mrs. Barrie had laid it aside,
expecting that some stranger would call for it, and
were instructing Bell to return it to the post office
in the evening, should no Miss Cameron cast up,
when Bell said, “My name’s Cameron; it’ll maybe be
for me.” It was, much to Mrs. Barrie’s embarrassment,
and told of the death of Bell’s aunt. Bell
had few relations,—none that seemed to care for her,
and consequently none that she kept up intimacy with.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL OF THE MANSE.</i></div>

<p>She was a year older than Mrs. Barrie. Her
first “place” had been in a small farmhouse, where
the manners were very primitive, and the work
was very constant. One of her questions shortly after
coming to the manse was, “Does Mr. Barrie aye take
his dinner with his coat on?” a thing she had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
seen before. Mrs. Barrie had a little difficulty in
getting her to understand the <i>proprieties</i>, but none
in getting her to do exactly as she was told. Bell
felt nothing a bother, took pleasantly any explanation
given as to her mistakes, laughed at them when
pointed out, and with a cheerful “I’ll mind that,”
thanked Mrs. Barrie. It took her some time to learn
the distinctive tones of the bells, the parlour, dining-room,
front door, etc.; and for the first week or two,
when a bell was rung, she ran to the nearest room and
tried it, then to another, sometimes to the disturbance
of the folks inside; but she soon came to know them.</p>

<p>It was a sight to see Bell unbuckle her gown,—which
when at work she gathered round her,
and fastened in some wonderfully <i>fast-loose</i> way,—shake
herself, and stalk off in response, especially
to the front door, to any ring that seemed peremptory.</p>

<p>Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland was making his first call
after the marriage. He handed Bell his card,
politely asking at the same time if Mr. and Mrs.
Barrie were at home. Bell looked at the card, but
it was in German text, and therefore unintelligible.
She looked at Sir John, but that did not help her;
she then turned on her heel,—the swiftest, cleverest
motion of the kind that could be imagined,—walked
briskly to Mrs. Barrie, and said, “There’s a man at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the door, a weel-put-on man, and he asked for you;
an’ he gied me a ticket, an’ he’s there yet.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie soon put such mistakes right. She
found Bell an apt scholar, scrupulously clean, sterlingly
honest, and always busy, though not fussy.
At first Bell was most at home among the hens, cows,
pigs, and in the garden, but she soon became well
up in all household work. Even the addition of the
children one by one never seemed to tax Bell’s
powers heavily. The first two, James and Mary,
were healthy, and in Bell’s homely phrase, “never
looked behind them;” but the third, “Wee Nellie,”
had been from her birth “a feeble, delicate little thing.”
When she was about three years old, scarlet fever
attacked the children, beginning with Lewis, the baby.
His was a mild case; so were those of James and
Mary, but Nellie’s was a severe one. Her pulse ran
very high, her little body was covered with the bright
scarlet “<i>rash</i>,” her throat sorely affected, her breathing
laboured and requiring more effort than the weak
constitution could spare. Mrs. Barrie and Bell were
unwearied in their efforts to relieve the poor sufferer,
and gently was she passed from knee to knee in her
restless moods, gently was she laid down again, and
coaxed and humoured and waited on with unspeakably
tender care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL AND WEE NELLIE.</i></div>

<p>Between Bell and Nellie there had been a special
intimacy. She had called herself “Bell’s bairn;” and
as her age and health did not admit of her joining
the other children at play, she was seldom out of
the kitchen, except when Bell wrapped her cosily in
a plaid, and carried her about the parks or garden,
where Bell diverted herself quite as much as the
“wee whitefaced girlie,” by humouring her childish
whims, and joining in, if not provoking, her wondering
interest. And ever and anon, as Nellie expressed
delight at what Bell said, or did, or pulled, or showed,
Bell would press her warmly to her breast, and croon
over words of endearment about her “wee croodlin’
doo,” “her ain darling Nellie,” “she was Bell’s bairn,”
and tell her that when she was big she would help
Bell to milk “Daisy,” and feed the hens. The cosiest
corner in the kitchen was Nellie’s “housie.” There
she would play for hours, sometimes sitting on
her little stool, and chatting with Bell “like an
auld body;” sometimes fondling her black-and-white
kitten Tibby; sometimes putting to sleep her favourite
doll “Black Tam,” who, although he had neither
arms nor legs, and his trunk had by long wear lost
the black paint, and appeared as bare timber well
time-soiled, still retained on his head, which had been
gouged out to imitate the woolly hair of the negro,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
crescent-shaped indents of his original blackness, and
his lips were flecked with streaks of their primitive
crimson; sometimes playing with broken bits of
china, drawing Bell’s attention to those with gold on
them as “Nellie’s pennies.” And not infrequently
did Bell take the wee lassie into her kindly lap, and
press her to her kindly bosom, and sing, and sigh
as she sung, her favourite if not only song of the
“Bonnie, bonnie banks of Benlomond.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>WEARIN’ AWA’.</i>”</div>

<p>It need hardly be recorded that Bell’s agony at
Nellie’s illness was only equalled by that of Mrs.
Barrie,—possibly by that of Mr. Barrie, but only
possibly. She had been struck with the hectic flush
which glowed on Nellie’s face, and saw that the fever
was sore on her; but she hoped against hope, until
on the seventh day of the illness a spasmodic movement
of the weak body, and a hazy gleam of the
weary eye, revealed to Bell that Nellie’s recovery
was hopeless. The thought of losing her came so
suddenly on Bell, that she nearly broke down in the
room; but restraining herself as her eye rested on
Mrs. Barrie’s calm motherly face, intent on anticipating
and ministering to the wants of the sufferer,
Bell whispered that she would “see if the bairns
were all right, and be back immediately,” and left
the room. She walked noiselessly through the lobby,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
at the darkest corner of it gave two or three great
“gulps,” and uttered a bitter “Oh! dear, dear.” This
was what nature demanded; this at least, more if she
could have got it; but this little snatch relieved her
pent-up heart, and braced her for further service. After
seeing that the other children were right, she glided
into the sick-room, from which Mr. Barrie, with a
remark or rather a sigh about “too many breaths,”
emerged as she entered. She took the fever-tossed
child gently out of Mrs. Barrie’s wearied arms, and
did her best to relieve the difficulty of breathing, so
harassing to the watchers, and so sore on the patient.
Gradually the fitful struggles became less violent;
Nellie got quieter, softer, powerless. She half opened
her eyes, then closed them slowly, and said in a faint
voice, with a long <i>eerie</i> tone, “Bell.” Bell, half
choking with grief, bent over her and kept saying,
“Yes, ye’re Bell’s bairn, ye’re Bell’s ain bairn;” but
observing her weary, weary face and increasing softness,
she looked wistfully at the invalid, then sympathizingly
at Mrs. Barrie, and, rising softly, laid the
wee lamb on Mrs. Barrie’s lap, slipped noiselessly to
Mr. Barrie’s study, and opening the door very slightly,
said, “Please, sir, come ben, or the angels will be
before you!” She got another gulp as she waited to
follow him into the sick-room, and that helped her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
greatly. The little darling recognised “papa,”—smiled
as she lisped his name,—smiled if possible more sweetly
as she heard her mother’s voice, in quivering accents,
saying, “My ain wee wee Nellie!” and sighed audibly,
“Mamma’s wee-wee,”—she then closed her eyes, and in
the act of raising her tiny hand to her throat, it fell
powerless, and Wee Nellie was Wee Nellie no more,
or rather, as Bell said, Wee Nellie for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THE LAND O’ THE LEAL.</i>”</div>

<p>Her delicate health and consequent helplessness, as
also her gentleness, had endeared her to Mr. Barrie.
When all was over, he muttered, “She was a pleasant
child, lovely and beautiful in her life;” and added in
a firmer voice, “It is well with the child, it is well.”
Bell lifted the little body from its mother’s lap, and
laid it gently on the bed. Her tears were streaming,
but she had got the first bitter pang over, and putting
her arm on, or rather round, Mrs. Barrie’s shoulder,
she said, “Come away, mem, for a little; I’ll put all
right.” Mrs. Barrie obeyed mechanically, and was
persuaded by Bell to lie down in bed. There wearied
nature asserted her prerogative, and she slept soundly
for a considerable time. When she returned to the
sick-room, all traces of illness, in the shape of couches,
baths, phials, and confusion, were away; the old crumb-cloth
which had been put down to preserve the carpet
was exchanged for a clean linen drugget; the fire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
out, the fire-place filled with fir-tops; the window was
open, and the blind drawn down; here and there
about the room were little muslin bags filled with
lavender-seed; and on the mantelpiece, which, when she
left, was covered with tumblers and cans and glasses
of medical stuff, overlapped with paper, or having
spoons in them to the hazard of their balance, stood
three tumblers filled with bunches of lavender; and
on the bed lay all that remained of Nellie, “dressed
and laid out,” her little body making all the more
appearance that the snow-white bedcover was tightly
laid over it. On her face lay a muslin handkerchief,
kept down by a bag of lavender on either side.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Barrie approached the bed, Bell walked to
the other side of it, and slowly folded down the face-cloth.
All traces of suffering and weariness had
vanished; the face was that of a child smiling in sleep.</p>

<p>“Bell,” said Mrs. Barrie, “she’s beautiful” (she had
never said that before of her or of any of her children),
“beautiful,—and she’s home. Of such is the kingdom
of Heaven.” Bell tried to speak. She got the length
of faltering out, “For ever with the Lord,” when Mrs.
Barrie stooped down to kiss her “lost lamb.” Bell
rather quickly folded the face-cloth over the mouth,
saying, “On the cheek or the broo, mem, no’ on the
mooth.” Although Mrs. Barrie’s frame shook as her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
lips touched the cold brow, she pressed them on it
lingeringly, and as she raised herself she said, “I
will go to her, she cannot return to me.” Then, looking
round the room, she said, “Bell, O Bell! I can never
repay, and I will <i>never</i> forget, your kindness at this
time.” She would have said more, but Bell broke
down, and Mrs. Barrie broke down, and both were
considerably better when the pent-up flood of sorrow
found relief.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of Blinkbonny stands a little
marble slab, only a few inches above the ground
bearing the following inscription:—</p>

<p class="noindent center p1" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 120%;">HELEN BARRIE</p>

<p class="noindent center" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 90%;">DIED 18TH MAY 1838, AGED 3 YEARS.</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THE BUTTERFLY ON A GRAVE.</i>”</div>

<p class="p1">The spot had no more constant visitor than Bell.
The flowers that in their seasons grew round it were
planted by her hand, and tended by her with constant
care; the only difference being that in weeding or
trimming <i>it</i> there was not the quick, bustling energy
which she exercised in the garden, but a reverent
slowness unusual for her. She never put her foot on
the sod under which Nellie lay; and although for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
first few visits she sighed mournfully as she read the
inscription (and she read it aloud to herself at every
visit), it was not long before her face lightened as she
uttered the last two words, and she would add in a
cheerful confirmatory tone, as if Nellie herself had
repeated the epitaph, “Yes, Nellie; yes, Bell’s bairn,
far better; far, far better.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#160;NEED hardly tell that between Mrs. Barrie and
Bell the relationship of mistress and servant was
more than cordial, more than intimate,—I can find
no better word to express it than perfect. To say
that Bell knew her place is a term much too bald; she
filled it, fulfilled it, <i>full</i>-filled it. She was devoted to
the family’s interest; her heart and mind were in her
work; she had a clear head, a strong arm, a blithe
happy manner, and an uncommonly large stock of
common sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL’S SLIDING SCALE.</i></div>

<p>She had a ready “knack” of dividing the articles
under her care, by a <i>sliding</i> scale of her own, so
as to put all to the best use: she laid aside some
for the dining-room on “company” days, and even at
a sudden call she was seldom found unprepared; some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
for the parlour, to suit old and young (for there was no
formal nursery in the manse,—Bell’s room, “off” the
kitchen, was best entitled to the name, although competing
claims might have been put forward by the
kitchen itself, the parlour, and even the study); some
for the kitchen, but <i>that</i> had not a high place in her
scale; a good deal for the poor,—plain, handy, and
given in good time and with discernment. Of one
thing she was very careful, and that was, that if any
food seemed likely to spoil, it was given away <i>before</i> it
went wrong; if any clothing, it was given clean, and
although often well patched, it was fit for immediate
use. There was a corner in the kitchen pantry with a
stock of comforts, and even luxuries, for cases of sickness,
old age, or special need. The dumb animals
were studied with thoughtful care, and they repaid it
well. Everything that could be used was used regularly
and methodically.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BUSY BEE.</i></div>

<p>Bell’s dress varied with her work. In the morning
she “sorted” the live stock, clad in what an artist
would have called a grotesque or picturesque costume,
according to the season. In winter her upper
garment was an old overcoat of Mr. Barrie’s—a
“Spencer;” in summer it was a loose-fitting jacket of
striped cotton, lilac and white; her linsey-woolsey
petticoat was of the right length for such work, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
all were shaken or brushed or beaten daily. She put
on her cotton “morning wrapper,” of blue with small
white spots, just before she “set” the breakfast, and
got “redd up” for the day in time to serve up the
dinner. While she had her set times for her regular
work, and “turned her hand” smartly to anything
more pressing, she observed no “Factory Act” restrictions
as to her hours of labour. Very early in the
morning the clank of Bell’s “pattens”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was heard as
she attended to her home farm, and till far on in the
evening she was working away anxiously and cheerfully.
Her rest was a change of work on week-days.
On the Sabbath afternoon she took what seemed likest
a rest, viz. a walk round the whole premises, leisurely,
observant, inquisitive, noticing everything, and mentally
noting a good deal for next week’s attention; varied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>by an occasional “saunter” into the gardens of the
neighbours for purposes of observation, comparison,
insight, or exchange.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Pattens were a primitive form of what are now known as overshoes,
although “undershoe” defines the patten more correctly. The upper
part was made of wood, like the frame of an ice-skate, but broader,—not
unlike the frame of an oval horse-brush; and it was put on by
pushing the foot firmly into overstraps made of leather or “girth
cloth,” in the same way as a horse-brush is fixed on a groom’s hand.
The under part was an oval-shaped ring of thin iron, measuring about
six inches long, four inches broad, and one inch deep. There being no
fastening at the back, the heel of the wearer’s shoe made a “slip-shod”
noise on the wooden sole, which, added to the clanking of the
iron soles, especially on any pavement or causeway, produced a double-beat
“clatterin’ clatter.” To the inexperienced they were as difficult to
walk with as skates are; they kept the foot about two inches from the
ground, and were taken off before entering the house by merely withdrawing
the foot. They not only kept the feet dry, but a “clean hoose.”</p>

</div>

<p>Her respect for Mr. and Mrs. Barrie was profound:
they were the handsomest couple in the parish, and
many parishes might have been gone over before a
more comely, gentle, ladylike, person than Mrs. Barrie
could be met with. Bell said, “They were, if that was
possible, better than they were bonnie;” and when Mrs.
Barrie told Bell, as she often did, to rest and take
things more leisurely, Bell would say, “I like to
work, mem, I like it; I canna be idle.” Mrs. Barrie’s
remonstrances were firmer on extra occasions, such as
a “heavy washing,” but Bell’s answer was, “It was
naething, naething at a’; and didna we get a grand day
for drying the claes?”—or at the “Spring cleanin’,”
when her answer was, “It’s best to get all the confusion
past and by wi’t. It was a nice thing a fresh,
clean hoose;—’deed, mem, it astonishes me to see hoo
much cleanin’ every place needs, although it’s no very
bad like before you begin.”</p>

<p>I may be dwelling too long on Bell, and it is not at
all unlikely that she may become the heroine of my
story, or rather the central figure round which the
“bits” are grouped. If so, I could not wish a better,
although Bell herself had no idea that she was such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
good servant, or that she did more than her bare duty;
she oftener felt she had not done as well as she wished.
She was far too sensible and busy a woman to think
much about herself; and should she read this, she would
be the first to say “she wished she had done better,—he
hasna tell’d my fau’ts.” Worthy, kindly, honest Bell!</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>GIVEN TO HOSPITALITY.</i>”</div>

<p>Mrs. Barrie’s housekeeping was the admiration, to
many it was the miracle, of the parish and district.
She was a good manager, and with such a helpmate as
Bell, she made her income do wonders. To the poor,
the manse was always open for judicious help; the
hospitality of the dining-room and parlour was substantial
and becoming. This was all the more astonishing
from the fact that Mrs. Barrie was “such a
delightful creature,” “such a charming person,” “quite
a lady,” “a model minister’s wife,” “so accomplished,”
“so amiable,” “so frank,” “so nice,” “so
attractive” (these are actual epithets used by her
friends), that the number of visitors, many of whom
were easily persuaded to become guests, was larger
than was desirable, and the consequent calls on the
larder and pantry were heavy. Indeed, this was a
subject of frequent remark among those who enjoyed
the hospitality of the manse, all wondering how <i>ever</i> she
could manage, and many “beseeching” Mrs. Barrie not
to trouble herself about <i>them</i>, as they only wished a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
quiet chat, although the length of many of their visits
made them more like visitations; Mrs. A. and Mrs. B.
suggesting that Mrs. C. and Mrs. D. might be more
considerate, whilst Mrs. C. and Mrs. D. were surprised
at the audacious manner in which Mrs. A. and Mrs. B.
thrust themselves on Mr. and Mrs. Barrie. It was really
difficult to withstand the attractions of the manse, and
Mr. and Mrs. Barrie, more particularly Mrs. Barrie,
was made a social martyr because she was so good, and
kind, and true.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Mrs. Barrie that her good
nature and good housekeeping were inconsiderately
drawn upon by many who should have known better.
She liked to see, and to contribute to, the enjoyment
of others, preferred being active to being passive in
this matter, and was “given to hospitality” from the
genuine sweetness of her nature; and while the sigh
of weariness often escaped her lips at the close of some
of the nice “sociables,” which had been prolonged so as
to interfere with domestic and other duties, she never
murmured; although she and Bell had often to encroach
on the hours of rest or sleep in order to keep everything
forward, and as they would like it.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie’s broadcloth was invariably fresh-looking,
and his linen faultless. Mrs. Barrie was at all
times becomingly dressed, and in the afternoons quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
“the lady, aye sae genty.” The boys and girls were
comfortably and neatly clad every day, specially so on
Sabbath days, and theirs was a happy home.</p>

<p>Before I began to describe the inmates of the
manse, I mentioned that Mrs. Barrie said, on leaving
the parlour, she was going to see if the “bairns were
happit.” She seldom spoke Scotch, but when she did,
it was with quaint emphasis and special sweetness.
There was no real need for Mrs. Barrie having any
anxiety on this subject of “happing,” as Bell was
always on the alert; but Mrs. Barrie’s motherly heart
could not rest until she had seen, and kissed in their
beds, her “wee croodlin’ doos.” She went first to
see Bell about the supper; then to Bell’s room, where
Mary and Flora were fast asleep; then to her own
room, where Lewis was sleeping soundly, but James
wide awake, scheming in his little head whether he
could not make a pair of skates, and wishing that Bell
would come up, as her “pattens” seemed the likeliest
raw material to make them of, and he had seen an old
pair in the byre. Mrs. Barrie heard his story, and said
they would never do; but that Mr. Martin was in the
parlour, and she would ask him the price of a pair, if
he would sleep like a good boy; and kissing both,
and “tucking” them in, she returned to the parlour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>BE “JUDEECIOUS.”</i></div>

<p>During her absence, Mr. Barrie spoke to me in
quite a fatherly way. He knew that I had a good
business and fair prospects, but that, since my father’s
death, I had bought a small property called Knowe
Park adjoining the village, and that this had absorbed
my available means to such an extent as to render it
a little difficult for me to carry on business comfortably
to the extent that my father had done. After
stating that he thought I was taking a wise step in
getting married, he said he found it generally the case,
although it sounded like a contradiction, that a married
house was more cheaply and much better kept than a
bachelor’s; and that he was in the custom of drawing
the attention of folks who were about to get married to
the subject of Life Assurance, or, if working men, to
Benefit Societies, and to the necessity of economy and
prudence in money matters. “But,” added he, “you
know these things better than I do, and I know you
will act jud<i>ee</i>ciously,” with a considerable emphasis on
the <i>ee</i>. And as he referred to the various relationships
of social life, he closed each section (for his advices
unconsciously ran into “heads and particulars,” like
his sermons), with, in short, “Be judeecious;” and so
clearly did he illustrate the inseparable connection
between wisdom and success or happiness in everything
he spoke of, that his advice seemed then, and
seems yet, summed up in, “Be judeecious.” He will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
excuse me for telling here, that in the parish he was
not unfrequently spoken of as “Judeecious;” and after
the lapse of fully forty years, he is still occasionally
styled, “Worthy old Judeecious,” by some elderly
warm friends, when recalling the sunny memories of
former days, although in general conversation he is
now spoken of as Dr. Barrie.</p>

<p>He related with considerable glee a saying of an
old minister, who, in speaking of money matters, used
to maintain that there were only three ways in which
a minister could make money—patrimony, matrimony,
or parsimony. He also told the story, which is long
ago threadbare, of the old merchant, who, when asked
why his son had not done so well in business as
he had, replied, “That’s easily explained: we old
folks began with a little house and a plain table, with
porridge and a herring, and got up to tea and a
‘chuckie’ (chicken); but the young folks began with a
braw house, and tea and chuckies and silks, and never
buckled up their sleeves to work.” When Mrs. Barrie
joined us, supper was already on the table. After
glancing into the cradle, to see if all was right with
“Gordie,” or Gordon Lennox, as his full name was,
she said, “Come away, gentlemen,” and seating herself
at the head of the table, did the honours in a graceful
and homely way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>BAIRNS WILL BE BAIRNS.</i>”</div>

<p>Bell had brought in the little black kettle, and it
kept singing by the fireside. When the simple meal
was over, Mr. Barrie and I made a “tumbler” of
toddy each, a rare thing for him, but he said it was
“New Year time,” and an “occasion;” and my health
was drunk, and that of Agnes, in which Mrs. Barrie
joined, a <i>very</i> rare thing for her; and Mr. Barrie had
just said, “Now, my dear, you must give Mr. Martin
the benefit of a little of your experience,” when the
door-handle was slowly turned, evidently by a less
firm hand than Bell’s, and a little head and part of a
little white nightgown, appeared at the half-opened
door, and a voice was heard timidly saying, “Mamma,”
followed by Bell’s voice, which, with a mixture of
astonishment and anxiety in its tone, was heard saying,
“James—here—at this time o’ nicht! whatever’s
the matter wi’ ye, laddie?” All in the room said,
“James!” but before Mrs. Barrie had time to apologize,
which she was proceeding to do to James for forgetting
the skates, although the strict bargain was that she
would speak to me if he <i>slept</i> like a good boy, he
threw light on the interruption, greatly to Bell’s relief,
by saying, “Mamma, have you spoken to Mr. Martin
about the skates?”</p>

<p>James’ single sentence told the whole story better
than any other words could have done it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
I told him to come to see me to-morrow, and
I would find him a pair. Mr. Barrie’s “Oh, Mr.
Martin, you—” and Mrs. Barrie’s “My dear boy,
you must—” and Bell’s “Skates! you’ll break your
legs, or drown—” were all interrupted, and all three
silenced by James’s very pronounced “Oh, thank you,
Mr. Martin, thank you very much;” and “Good night,
James,” had come from all round the supper table, and
Bell had got him in hand to lead him away, and the
door was all but closed, when it opened again. There
seemed a struggle going on between James and Bell
before he reappeared, this time at full length, with his
one arm distended towards the lobby, his feet planted
and his body inclined forwards, as if in resistance to
an outward pull, and his other arm clenching firmly
the upper bead of the dado of the parlour.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Martin, please, sir, when will I come
to-morrow?” said the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nine o’clock, James,” said I, “or any time after that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir,” said he; and looking at Mrs.
Barrie, said, “May I go, mamma?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see to-morrow,” replied Mrs. Barrie; “do
go to bed like a good boy.”</p>

<p>This was too indefinite for James. “But please,
mamma, may I go?” pleaded the boy with difficulty,
for Bell was pulling him strongly outwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>CAUGHT TRIPPING.</i></div>

<p>“Yes,” came from Mr. Barrie, fettered by some
conditions about not going on the “Loch” without
getting mamma’s permission, which James did
not hear. Bell’s strength had mastered his, and the
door was closed. They went up-stairs, Bell enlarging
on broken legs and drowning, James on trying to learn
on the “pattens;” and Bell had to threaten to go down
to me, and tell me not to give him them, and had
actually feigned a determined start on that errand,
when James said, “Oh, don’t, Bell; I’ll be a good boy,
and sleep,” which he did.</p>

<p>James being thus pleasantly disposed of, Mrs.
Barrie began her record of experiences, which proved
so interesting, that before she had gone on long, I so
far forgot myself as to say, “Oh! how I wish Agnes
had been here!” Mrs. Barrie caught me at once, and
said with a merry smile, “Can you not do with us for
an hour? or rather, why did you not bring her with
you?”—then went on in a homely way with her
useful hints and good advice, illustrating these by
incidents that had occurred in her household.</p>

<p>A “for instance,” or “I remember on one occasion,”
was followed by an account of a sudden call on her
larder,—or a valuable dress torn, or soiled, or spoiled,—or
a breakage,—or an unexpectedly heavy tradesman’s
account,—or something that was much needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and apparently beyond her power and purse, yet
eventually procured by her ingenuity and patience,—or
her little plans to make Mr. Barrie’s coat into
a suit for James and possibly a vest for Lewie.
And as her family increased, her scheming, and
shaping, and sewing, and turning of garments to keep
them “cosy,” were prettily told, and, if I may use
such a term, romantic in their very simplicity. I
cannot forget the pathos with which she told of a
serious and alarming illness caught by Mr. Barrie the
week after Nellie’s death, at a funeral in a distant part
of the parish, but doubtless aggravated by the disturbed
state of his mind and the disorganized state of
his frame. For, good man as he was, and perfectly
resigned to God’s will, he felt keenly the blank in the
home,—for “a little chair was empty there;” and
although I could not say he murmured, I know that
he greatly missed “the touch of a vanished hand, and
the sound of a voice that is still” (<i>Tennyson</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. BARRIE’S ILLNESS.</i></div>

<p>“He was very ill,” said she; “alarmingly ill,—so
ill that I suggested to Dr. Stevenson, or rather it
struck the doctor and myself at the same moment,
that it would be desirable to call in an Edinburgh
consulting physician. I confess that the fee was a
serious consideration, as I knew that it would prevent
my getting the new wincey dresses for myself and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
girls that I was saving up for; although this only
floated through my mind in its excited state, and
required no effort to cast off. The professor came, and
went into the case minutely. Never can I forget the
kindly way in which he said that our family doctor
had treated the case exactly as he himself would have
done,—that Mr. Barrie was a splendid patient, self-possessed,
scrupulously obedient to the doctor’s orders,
a model of passive subjection to the minutiæ of
medical requirements; and that his good constitution,
which had been conserved by his regular and correct
life, rendered the case a hopeful one, still one requiring
every attention and care. He said something
about myself in that matter that I will not repeat.
All I said was, I had a servant worth her weight in
gold,—Bell.”</p>

<p>“That’s beyond doubt,” said Mr. Barrie and I
simultaneously. Mrs. Barrie went on:</p>

<p>“He also said that he had successfully treated
similar cases on a method of his own, and that the
surroundings of Mr. Barrie’s case were such as to
make him most anxious to have it treated with
scrupulous attention to the most minute details of
this new system,—that he would write these out
carefully, and be in correspondence with Dr. Stevenson,
and come out again if necessary. I asked his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
fee; he said not to mind at present, and when I
pressed him he said he would write me. He was
very particular in writing specific directions; and
Dr. Stevenson more fully explained these, so that we
were able to carry them out to the letter. Three
days after his visit the carrier brought a small hamper
of medicines and cordials from the professor, with
full instructions as to their use, and a letter to
myself”—here she sobbed. Tears had frequently
trembled in her eyes as she told the story of the illness,
but they trickled down as she spoke of the letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</i>”</div>

<p>Drying her tears, however, she proceeded: “In the
letter he expressed his gratitude at having it in his
power to minister ‘to the necessities of saints,’ his
delight at having his method of treatment tried so
completely, and”—here she halted; then after a
moment’s pause said, “Well, I’m quoting,—and with
such nursing. He added that as he had promised to
refer to the fee, he would say that he would be more
than repaid by Mr. Barrie’s recovery, as it would
fortify him in adopting the treatment generally, and
announcing it to the profession. Mr. Barrie had
meantime got ‘the turn.’ I snatched a few minutes to
reply to the professor’s letter. It was written with a
full heart, but a shaking hand. I fear <i>my</i> letter was
but a sorry production; but,” she said firmly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with a beaming eye, “the professor’s letter is lying
in my mother’s Bible, beside my marriage lines and
little Nellie’s hair. It is not exactly as he sent it;
there are not only the crumpled spots where my tears
fell, but under his signature I wrote, before putting
it amongst my treasures, ‘the Good Samaritan.’
Mr. Barrie wonders why I did not rather write the
‘Beloved Physician;’ that would have done very well,
but I like ‘the Good Samaritan’ better; and now that
I think of it, I will get it out to-morrow, and Mr.
Barrie can add ‘the Beloved Physician’ himself.”</p>

<p>She did not tell then, but I heard from the
“carrier,” that the basket in which the cordials were
sent was first well washed and bleached by Bell, then
filled with the best her hen-roost, and dairy, and
garden could afford, and sent to the physician without
any address,—Bell herself having charged the carrier
“just to hand it in an’ come away,—no’ to say where
it cam’ frae.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie did not confine herself merely to matters
of thrift and housekeeping, but dwelt on the higher
feelings of our nature, the social sympathies, and the
ties and joys of home and kindred. But I could not
do justice to the fine taste with which she described
or enforced these.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie occasionally joined in the conversation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
but he was interjectional, and more impressive from
his tone, the expression of his countenance, and his
slight gestures, than from the words he used. When
the soiled dress was spoken of, he said with a smile,
“Birniepark,”—referring to an awkward servant having
spilt a sauceboat full of gravy on Mrs. Barrie’s wedding
dress. When “breakage” was mentioned, he
said, “Janet,”—recalling an officious, brisk young lady,
who, at one of the annual tea meetings of the Sabbath-school
teachers in the manse, had seized the tray with
great bounce, to <i>help away</i> with the tea-things, and
had literally succeeded, as in crossing the lobby she
stumbled, and every dish was broken. When the
physician’s letter was referred to, he merely said,
“Ebenezer,—Epaphroditus,—Onesiphorus.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie finished by giving a few simple rules
which she had herself tried to carry out: “Never
buy anything you do not need; look twice at a
cheap bargain; use the least of everything, lose the
least of everything, and make the most of everything;
save all you can, use all you can, and be sure and
give all you can. So much for the housekeeping;
but be as careful of your heart as of your purse, and
be kindly affectioned one towards another, in honour
preferring one another.”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>DILEMMAS.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Barrie summed up with: “In fact, be judeecious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Practise economy, not parsimony; use the world as
not abusing it; owe no man anything but to love one
another,—a debt that can never be fully discharged.
Love begets love.”</p>

<p>Glancing at the timepiece, I saw that the hour was
rather later than I imagined; and having risen, I was
thanking Mrs. Barrie for her hearty counsel, and had
added that I hoped she would call at Greenknowe
before the marriage, and be as kind to Agnes as she
had been to me. I saw by Mrs. Barrie’s eye that she
had me again.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said she with great glee, “you will
not wish me to call on you both after you are married!
I quite expected you to invite me; but Agnes will be
calling to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“What!” said I; “good-bye? She’s not going so
far away.”</p>

<p>“But,” said she, “she will make a P.P.C. call.”</p>

<p>“A what?” said I; for I did not know what P.P.C.
meant.</p>

<p>“Ask her,” replied she; “I dare not trust myself to
quote French in full now.”</p>

<p>I had begun to thank Mr. Barrie, when he said
gravely, “Mr. Martin, I greatly desire that there shall
be family worship in every house in the parish, and
I impress this on all intending young housekeepers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
so you will kindly take the service for me to-night.”
And without waiting for a reply, he moved towards
the handle of the bell, and was pulling it (it was a
little bone barrel at the end of a bit of green cord),
saying, “We’ll call Bell in,” when I put my hand
on his, and said excitedly, “Mr. Barrie! please, Mr.
Barrie, do excuse me,—pray, don’t ask me to-night,
please don’t!” for the sudden call and circumstances
made me quite nervous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie kindly came to my relief by wishing
me a hearty good-night, and saying, “Mr. Martin may
have another call to make to-night, my dear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie followed me to the lobby, and said he
hoped I would excuse his rather hasty invitation to
conduct family worship; he had forgotten the apostolic
injunction, “Lay hands suddenly on no man.”
Then, taking me warmly by the hand, he said, “I
rejoice with you to-night at the step you are taking; it
is not only judeecious, but promises to be a very happy
one for yourselves and your circle. But pray remember
the ‘<i>Nisi Dominus frustra</i>’ of your college days,—‘Except
the Lord do build the house, they labour in
vain that build it.’” There was another firm shake
of the hand as we parted, and I heard his voice saying
something about taking care of the slippery roads, as I
was “some other body’s property now.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY stay at the manse had been longer than
I expected. When I reached Greenknowe,
I had hardly recovered from the scare I had got
by the proposal to conduct family worship, and my
account of the visit to the manse, although short, was
a jumble about Bell, and skates, and good Samaritans.
Agnes looked at me anxiously, and said, “Are you well
enough? You look excited.” I told her what had
excited me, at which she first laughed, then looked
thoughtful, then sympathetic, and said, “You’re tired,
and it is late; come over to-morrow night, if you
can;” and after a pause she said, “My mother has
often wished me to ask you to make family worship
here, and you will just begin to-morrow night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>This was adding fuel to flame; so, observing my
restlessness, she said, “Oh, Robert, forgive me for
adding to your excitement” (that was easily done,—the
forgiveness, I mean); “you need a good night’s rest.”
I did very much, but I did not get it.</p>

<p>I went to bed immediately on going home, tossed
and tumbled about, angry at myself for being so unwilling
to undertake a duty which, as at one time an
aspirant to the ministry, should not have unhinged
me. Then my conscience smote me for being undecided
in religious matters; then I resolved to be more
decided, and began to compose my first social prayer.
As I tried this, I found one bit forgotten as another
was being thought over. I was about to rise and
<i>write</i> a prayer, but checked myself, and resolved to be
a <i>man</i> (when a man does this, he is more likely to
prove himself a child), and to look for help when it
was needed where it was to be found.</p>

<div class="leftnote" style="width: 10%;"><i>P.P.C.</i></div>

<p>Next night found me at Greenknowe, quietly
retailing Mr. and Mrs. Barrie’s sayings; and the
“books” were brought in before supper, and I at least
got through. Agnes said she was much obliged to
me. Mrs. Stewart said little more than “Thank you;”
but after the old lady had retired, Agnes told me, in
an indirect, quiet way, that Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Nab never referred
to her mother as “His aged servant,” which I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
unwisely done, but as “the handmaid of the Lord.”
A young college friend had lost a legacy by a similar
mistake in the case of a maiden aunt. My readers
will excuse me for leaving this bit to suggest its
own lesson. Mrs. Stewart was barely sixty years
old: how our ideas of “aged” change as we age ourselves!</p>

<p>I carried quite a bundle of letters to the post office
that night, many of them invitations to the marriage,
others P.P.Cs., which I got explained by Agnes, after a
quick sideward movement of the head down, followed
by a slow movement of it up, and an inquiring stare,
as much as to say, Do you <i>really</i> not know? “It’s
<i>pour prendre congé</i>—to take leave, to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, “Mrs. Barrie spoke about P.P.C.; and
when I asked the meaning, she said something about
French, and to ask you. That’s P.P.C., is it?”</p>

<p>The marriage took place, but I spare my readers an
account of it. I could not describe the dresses so as to
<i>inform</i> the ladies, nor the presents (which now-a-days
are so numerous and costly as to have to undergo the
trying ordeal of being laid out for exhibition in a
special room), for these were more useful than
ornamental. Many of them were esteemed for the
donor’s sake rather than for their intrinsic value;
none more so than a book, called <i>Cottage Comforts</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
from Mrs. Barrie, which proved very useful to us, and
became Agnes’s present to young housekeepers she was
interested in, many of whom in after life thanked her
for the good hints and help it gave them. Mr. Barrie
gave me a copy of the <i>Confession of Faith</i>, and asked
me to read it carefully. Although it was the standard
of the Church to which I belonged, and I had declared
my adherence to it, I had till then hardly opened it.
When I did look into it, many of its statements
seemed harsh, and stated so baldly in logical order and
theological language, that they seemed to me very
different from the teachings of the Bible, interwoven
and relieved as these are by illustration, narrative, and
incident; and I still think, because it wants the charm
of the associations with which the doctrines are joined
in the Scriptures, that it is apt to bewilder, if not to
prejudice unfavourably, the ordinary reader; but the
more I examine it, and compare the parallel passages
(<i>i.e.</i> references to texts confirming the doctrines), I see
it deserves the name Mr. Barrie gives it in its relation
to the Bible,—“an excellent summary of which is to
be found in the Westminster Confession of Faith.”
Although the excellence is more marked than the
summariness; it is a pretty long <i>summary</i>. The
“Apostles’ Creed” comes nearer that.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PLAIN SPEAKING.</i></div>

<p>Dinner followed almost immediately after the marriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
There was a little speechmaking after dinner,
or “the collation,” as Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Nab called it. Mr. Barrie,
in proposing our health, was neat and hearty. He had
a hit at me “once thinking of getting married;”—told
a story of a lad who, when going to seek a wife, looked
so unhappy that his mother said to him, “Keep up
yer heart, Johnnie, ma man; faint heart never won
fair lady;” “Eh, mother,” said Johnnie, “I’ve mair need
to keep it down, for it’s amaist in my mou’ a’ready;”—wished
us many happy days, and hoped our married
life would be happier than his had been. It took
some of us a few seconds to see that this was a very,
very good wish.</p>

<p>My uncle proposed Mrs. Stewart’s health. He was
a plain, blunt man, and spoke of her as his “auld
friend.” Mrs. Stewart was in grand spirits, and said,
“Auld, Mr. Martin! auld! I’m no’ sae auld as you.”
“Weel, ye’re as auld-like, ony way,” said the honest
man; and Mrs. Stewart and he joined as heartily in
the laugh that followed as any of us, and it was so long
that he ended his speech by a nod to Mrs. Stewart,
and “Here’s t’ye, mem; your very good health.”</p>

<p>A confirmed bachelor proposed the bridesmaids.
He was, of course, unable to do justice to the toast,
with “<i>such</i>” bridesmaids, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Nab gave the health of Mr. Barrie. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
spoke well; my uncle said he had “a grand stock o’
dictionar’ and college-bred words.”.</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THE FROSTIT CORN.</i>”</div>

<p>Some songs were sung. The bachelor friend had a
fine voice, and had cultivated it carefully. Few could
equal him at “Gae fetch to me a pint o’ wine;” and
when pressed to sing it, he bantered about having lost
his best song, “O Nanny, wilt thou gang wi’ me?”
he had not even got round sufficiently to try “My
Nannie’s awa’,” but he hoped he would regain his
spirits; he would try “When our king comes o’er the
water,” and gave it in fine style. A cousin of Agnes’s,
her senior by a very few years, sang “A’body’s like
to get married but me,” with sweetness and humour,
the last three verses so very well as to put our
bachelor friend in great spirits. When she finished
the following verse, the last one—</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It’s hard to tak’ shelter behint a laigh dyke,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">my uncle said, “Ye maun be ill to please; it canna
hae been for want o’ offers.” He was then pressed to
sing, and did his best; the words were new to all of
us, but the tune, “Johnnie Cope,” was familiar. He
said it was written by a friend of his, a farmer
beside him. We suspected that the author was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
<i>always</i> very near him. He had sung it at the rent
dinner in his laird’s house, and the laird was delighted
with it, although it “wasna jist exactly what he wad

<p>Need I say that the applause was loud, and long, and
<i>real</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>BLITHE AN’ MERRY WERE WE A’.</i>”</div>

<p>Marriage trips, wedding tours, were not so common
forty years ago as they are now: we had none. Shortly
after my uncle’s song was finished, and with the glee
it inspired still beaming in their faces, the guests went
to <i>our</i> house. We were the last to leave, which we did
under a shower of old shoes “for luck.” There was the
usual gathering of noisy children round the bride’s
door, waiting for the coppers scattered on such
occasions; and as they scrambled for them, we got
into the drosky, and were driven home, followed by
an increasing number of children cheering in an
intermittent way, all anxious to be in time for the
“scatterin’ o’ the ha’pennies,” which had to be repeated
at the bridegroom’s door. There was an outer
circle of grown-up people, who showed their goodwill
by a welcoming cheer. As Agnes crossed her threshold,
my oldest sister, who had come to “receive” her,
allowed an oat cake to fall on the young wife’s head;
and the younger folks scrambled for the bits, as these
had some not very clearly defined faculty of foretelling
their future luck, especially if confirmed by a dream
over the bridescake. Agnes was placed by the matrons
present at the head of the supper table, and thereby
installed as mistress of the house. After supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
there were games, in which the elderly folks joined,
the older men with demonstrative glee. The more
matronly matrons required a good deal of pressing—their
“play days were bye;” but most of them went
through a short game, others kept remonstrating with
the old men, especially their own husbands, who were
oftener up, and who even when looking on capered and
“hooched” (<i>i.e.</i> shouted merrily):—“Tammas, Tammas!
ye’re forgettin’ yersel’;”—“Stop that auld man o’
mine; he’ll hurt himsel’;”—“Oh man, James, ye’re
ower auld for sic nonsense. Let the young folks carry
on the games noo.”</p>

<p>After the first round of games, in which all the
guests—old and young—took part, and the seniors had
shown their <i>skill</i>, these mostly settled to be spectators,
all the while enjoying the frolics of the young
folk as much as their own canty cracks, whilst the
younger portion had the carrying on of the fun, which
they did right merrily. Old Scotch songs were sung,
and kindly sentiments uttered, as those will readily
believe whose memory can recall the homely convivialities
of forty or fifty years ago. My uncle was
pressed by old and young to sing another song like
“The Frostit Corn,”—“one we did not hear every day,”—“a
real country-fireside song.” He said he “would
gie ane; it was no’ as gude as ‘The Frostit Corn.’ It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
was ca’d ‘The Country Rockin’.’ But maist o’ ye’ll no’
ken what a rockin’ is. It’s a gatherin’ o’ neebors for a
night’s diversion. The women brang their ‘rocks’—things
for spinning woo’ or lint wi’, an’ birled an’
span an’ crackit awa’. I’ve seen them hunders o’
times in my young days, but there’s no sic a thing noo
as ‘the rock and the wee pickle tow.’ Mind it’s
hamespun an’ countrified.” Then he began:—</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>AUNTIE MATTIE ON SONGS.</i></div>

<p>In the enthusiastic chorus every voice joined, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
over and over again after the last verse did the chorus
ring through the room; and, “Anither, Mr. Martin,
anither like that!” was rained on the canny man. During
the pause, Auntie Mattie, a sister of Mrs. Stewart’s,
said, “Sing the ‘Farmer’s Ingle,’ Mr. Martin, for auld
langsyne. I like it better than the ‘Rockin’.”</p>

<p>“Sae dae I,” said my uncle, “but it’s threadbare noo.”</p>

<p>“Threadbare!” said Auntie Mattie; “threadbare, did
ye say, Mr. Martin? A sang that’s worth ca’in’ a sang
at a’ will never get threadbare, ony mair than the sun’ll
get auld-fashioned altho’ we see’t every day o’ our
lives; and ye’ll surely sing’t to obleege me?”</p>

<p>Auntie Mattie was a sonsy, kindly, cheery woman—a’body’s
body; but she hardly expected that my uncle
would bring her in for a song by the paction he made.</p>

<p>“Mattie,” said he,—“oh, I beg yer pardon, I should
hae ca’d ye Mrs. Dickson, but ye lookit sae like what
ye did langsyne that Mattie cam’ oot afore I kent,—I’ll
sing the ‘Farmer’s Ingle’ if ye’ll sing the ‘Lawland
lads think they are fine.’ Ye sang’t at our waddin’, an’
it’s ringin’ in my heid yet. Thae auld sangs are worth
a bushel o’ the new trash the folk ca’ sangs noo-a-days.
Come awa’, my bonnie leddy, let’s hear the
‘Lawland Lads,’ and ye’ll hae the ‘Farmer’s Ingle’
as weel as I can gie’t; that ye will.”</p>

<p>Auntie Mattie said, “Hoots!” and “Nonsense!” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
that “her voice was clean gane;” but her singing of
the “Lawland Lads” contradicted all these statements,
and was so sweet, and so true, and so natural, as to
command strict silence at the second note, which
deepened as she proceeded. The verse—</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Few compliments between us pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I ca’ him aye my Hieland laddie,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">An’ rows me in his tartan plaidie”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>as <i>she</i> sung it, was a thing to be remembered. When
she had finished and the sincere applause was over,
which took the shape of little complimentary speeches
to her, and expressions of mutual delight to one
another, rather than the noisy demonstration which
had followed my uncle’s songs, my uncle said, “Eh,
Mattie—hoots! excuse me. Eh, Mrs. Dickson, there’s
no’ a fail’d inch o’ ye. That sang was like caller
air; it was jist grand, splendid a’thegither. It’s
taen the breath frae me completely. I daurna sing
after that.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THE FARMER’S INGLE.</i>”</div>

<p>“Come away, Mr. Martin,” said she; “a bargain’s a
bargain. Come away wi’ the ‘Farmer’s Ingle,’” which
he did. And I give the song as he sang it, as, although
common in country districts in my young days, it is
little sung now. The chorus was well known to us

<p>The “thinking of going home,” which had been hinted
at once or twice before, was now general, and the party
broke up with good wishes and kind feelings warmly
expressed: “We’ve haen a grand nicht o’t!”—“Lang
may ye be spared to ane anither, an’ aye be as happy
as ye’ve made your freends the nicht!”—crowned by
“Auld Langsyne,” with, as the play-bills have it, “the
whole strength of the company.”</p>

<p>Our house was above the shop; separate villas, now
so common for tradesmen and shopkeepers, were then
only occupied by the gentry. The system of villas
in the outskirts has shortened the hours of business,
and is healthier, but the above-the-shop houses kept
a man, and often, be it said with all honour, his wife,
thoroughly at the head of affairs. In many businesses,
then as yet, the wives were invaluable. Who cannot
recall the active, polite, effective way in which the
Mistress “kept the shop”? and how nice it was to be
served by her own self, with her interchange of homely
civilities, and the ready knack she had of hitting on
what was wanted! This good custom is happily still
not uncommon. Long may it continue!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PEGGY RITCHIE ON THE KIRKYARD.</i></div>

<p>My business did not require Agnes to be in the
shop, but in my absence she used to look in to help
the lad or lads, and took to it, and the customers took
to her. Often, also, when the assistants were out, she
came down to keep me (maybe to keep herself) from
wearying; and she soon made such changes as only an
orderly woman can devise; and from being interested,
she easily became acquainted with the details, and
made alterations here and reforms there that resulted
in our increased prosperity and comfort. We went on
steadily making things better, soon got to be easier in
money matters, then laid past a little, then looked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
for some investment. But I am the writer, not the subject,
of these “bits,” and will spare my readers the dry
details of a homely life in a country village. I only
add that we had no extra call on our means in the
way of having to bring up a family. This was a sore
subject many years ago, but it is a mere fact now.</p>

<p>My wife being anxious to get everything to her
mind about the house, began next morning to clear
up, and sent for some folks who were very glad to get
some of the substantial remains to eke out their
scanty tables. One of these was Peggy Ritchie. She
had been a servant in my father’s house at the time
of his death, and my housekeeper for nearly a year
thereafter. She had married Gavin Sinclair, a widower
with a moderately-sized family. Her father was the
sexton and minister’s man, but now unfit for work, and
Gavin, or Guy as he was commonly called, “officiated”
instead of old Adam Ritchie. Peggy said she was
“thankfu’ to get onything, forbye being proud to be
mindit, for Guy was very slack the noo, there werena
near sae mony deaths as ane would expect this cauld
weather. It was very unfortunate, it came at an ill
time; if there wasna something doin’ in the kirkyard
soon, it wad be a bad job. Guy could say, as the
beadle o’ Borthwick said to the Lord Chief Baron, ‘he
hadna buried a leevin’ craitur for six weeks.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>“And how’s your father, Peggy?” said my wife.</p>

<p>“Very middlin’, Mrs. Martin” (Peggy used <i>Mrs.</i> very
often and <i>very</i> graciously); “but he was sayin’ to Guy
last nicht, after Mr. Barrie gaed out,—he ca’d in to see
my faither; he often ca’s. I’m aye glad to see him.
He kens what puir folk need in cauld weather. Well,
as I was sayin’, my faither says to Guy, ‘Be thankfu’
ye hae Mr. Barrie to deal wi’; he’s a considerate man
an’ a gentleman. Ane o’ the ministers before him, no’
to name onybody,—it’s as weel no’ to gie names,—weel,
ane o’ the ministers in my day,’ says my faither,
‘was the maist pernickety, impatient, bathersome craitur’
ever was seen. If he wanted onything, ye must do’t
in an instant, or he was fair dancin’ wi’ passion. It was
a thrang time in the kirkyard, a sair winter, and I had
some idle men helpin’ me. The minister was getting
something done to the manse, and aye send-sendin’
for me to help, and to come that very moment. I’ve
actually seen me,’ says my faither, ‘hae to bring men
out o’ the very grave to serve him.’ My faither’s sair
failed.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Peggy had been my housekeeper, my
wife asked if there was anything I was specially fond
of, any special dishes, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MATHIESON’S HEID.</i></div>

<p>Peggy’s sense of importance was flattered at being
<i>consulted</i> (as she afterwards put it), and she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with a gesture of surprise, “The maister,—Maister
Martin,—there was nae man could be easier pleased
wi’ his meat than him. Gie him a lamb leg an’ a
berry tart to his denner, an’ he was perfectly satisfied.”
So he may, thought my wife.</p>

<p>“Speakin’ about denners,” continued Peggy, “Miss
Park got a terrible fricht last Saturday nicht. The
flesher’s laddie was takin’ a sheep’s heid to the
Mathiesons, but as there was naebody in the house,
he raps on Miss Park’s door,—she stops next them.
Weel, her servant was out, an’ she answers the door
hersel’. She’s an awfu’ nervish craitur’, so she opens
a wee bit o’ the door, a’ shakin’, and disna the laddie
shove the sheep’s heid bang in? The door was that
little open that the neck rubbit against her hands; and
he bawls out, ‘Mathieson’s heid,’ an’ let it fa’ in the
lobby an’ awa’ in a moment. She was that fear’d that
she couldna move, but keepit starin’ awa’ at the ugly
black head, thinking a’ sorts o’ things. When her
servant cam’ in she was fair chitterin’ wi’ fear. It
was real thochtless o’ the laddie.”</p>

but nothing of special interest occurred

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SEED POTATOES.</i></div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE agitation which resulted in the Disruption of
1843, when nearly five hundred ministers left the
Established Church of Scotland and formed the “Free
Church,” extended even to the quiet parish of Blinkbonny,
although Mr. Barrie had not taken an active
part in the conferences held on the subjects in dispute
between the Government and the Non-Intrusionists, as
they were sometimes called. He rather avoided the
subject; but in the presbytery his attitude indicated
that his sympathies were with those who ultimately
formed the Free Church,—so much so that many of his
friends remonstrated with him, urging him to be careful,
to consider his family, not to commit himself hastily.
The latter advice Mr. Barrie carried out by thanking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
is advisers very sincerely, assuring them that he would
endeavour to act conscientiously and “judeeciously;”
and although he did not commit himself, his answer
was made the basis of different conclusions, according
as the “conscientiously” or the “judeeciously” was
put foremost.</p>

<p>He more nearly committed himself to Bell than to
any other person, and this accidentally. She was the
head, the only gardener, and early spring found her
deeply absorbed in the arrangement of the season’s
crops. She had already planted peas and beans, and
sundry vegetables; had carefully cut the seed of the
early potatoes, making each potato yield as many bits
with eyes or buds as she thought safe; and had the
“dibble” in her hand to form the holes into which to
drop the seed, when Mr. Barrie, returning from the
village, stopped at the “break” which she was beginning
to plant.</p>

<p>He never passed Bell without some kindly word.
In the garden it was generally, “Well, Bell, always at
it?” and Bell’s “Yes, sir” followed him, for he generally
walked on. But on this occasion he stood for
a few seconds, long enough for Bell to look at him
inquiringly, then to wonder whether to speak or not.
At length Mr. Barrie said, with something like an
introductory sigh:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Bell, planting the early potatoes, I see.
How will you look if we have to flit soon and leave
the crop to some other body?”</p>

<p>“Flit!” said Bell; “flit! What d’ye mean, sir?
We’ll flit nane;” and forgetting her usual good
manners, she added, “Ye havena gotten a call to ony
ither kirk that I’ve heard o’, or to ony o’ the big town
kirks, have ye, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that, Bell; but we <i>may</i> have to
leave the manse for all that. But if we have, we will
leave the garden in such a state as to be a credit to
us.” Then collecting himself, and observing her
perplexed face, he made a passing remark on the
weather, and had moved towards the manse, too confused
to be able to reply to Bell’s practical question,
which cut him to the quick, simple as it was, “What
for did ye no’ speak about that before I cut the
pitaties, sir?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.</i></div>

<p>The question was not asked in Bell’s usual respectful
tone, and although she saw that Mr. Barrie had
got into the house, she kept looking at the closed
door as if it should answer her; then slowly surveyed
the garden, the mould of which had been enriched by
her industry. She rested her eye first on what she had
already planted, next on what she intended to plant;
wistfully on the rows that were already above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
ground, and that had an hour before been her pride;
then looked again at the manse door with an expression
of bewilderment. She took the hamper which
contained the seed-potatoes in the one hand, still
holding the dibble in the other, and walked dreamily
round the parts of the garden that were planted. The
pace was very unlike her everyday one; it was slow,
heavy, interrupted. Every few steps she looked
around her solemnly, until she reached the top of the
garden, when, as if some forgotten engagement had
flashed across her mind, she walked briskly to the outhouse,
laid down her perplexing seed-potatoes, locked
the door, and tidied herself more quickly and more
carelessly than usual. Putting on her shawl and a
knitted worsted black cap or “mutch” with a crimson
border (for she wore a bonnet only on Sundays), something
like a hood (it had a name, which I now forget),
she went to Mrs. Barrie to inquire if she needed anything
from the village,—that being Bell’s way of
asking whether she could get out for a short time.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Bell,” said Mrs. Barrie, “nothing at all
that I remember of; and I am anxious to have as
little as possible in the house at present.”</p>

<p>This added to Bell’s confusion and quickened her
step. She made straight for the village. I happened
to be at the door at the time, and, struck with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
smartness with which she was walking, I apprehended
that there might be something wrong at the manse,
and had taken a step or two towards her. While yet
about two yards distant she asked quickly, “Hoo’s
the garden doing, Mr. Martin?”</p>

<p>“Just middlin’, Bell; but come round and see it.”</p>

<p>As we went she further asked, “Have ye gotten
your early taties in yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I; “my garden is far behind this year.
I have been trying to get that house ready for the
Whitsunday term. Ye’ll see that we’re putting a
better house on the Knowe Park? It’s a nice stance.
The old cottage was done, so we’re putting up a good
plain house; but the plasterers have dilly-dallied;
they’re a provoking set.”</p>

<p>We were now in the garden. Bell’s first remark
was, “This is no’ like you, Mr. Martin; but, however,
I want to ask ye a secret” (so Bell put it). “Can
you tell me if Mr. Barrie’s gotten a call, or if he’s
likely to get a call, to ony other kirk?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know or have heard of.”</p>

<p>Then she told me very circumstantially what Mr.
Barrie had said, and what Mrs. Barrie had said, and
ended by asking, “What can <i>you</i> mak’ o’ what he said
about the taties?”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>BELL’S VIEW OF THE CASE.</i></div>

<p>I tried to explain that it was possible that many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
inisters would leave the Church of Scotland on
account of something the Government had done.</p>

<p>“What!” said Bell firmly; “that cannot be—that’s
no’ possible. The Government wadna daur to meddle
wi’ Mr. Barrie. There may be as gude ministers, but
there’s nane better. Let them try to put out Mr.
Barrie, and they would see a bonnie stramash,—that
they would. Leave the manse! Na; thae covenantin’
times are a’ past. Just let Government try’t.”</p>

<p>I said that it was not at all likely that force would
be required, as I believed that if the Government
persisted in doing what the ministers thought wrong,
the ministers would leave the Church quietly rather
than submit to have their rights and those of the
Christian Church interfered with.</p>

<p>“There’s nae Government will ever gang against
gude ministers, at ony rate against Mr. Barrie; they’re
the best friends the Government has,” said Bell.
Then looking at it in her particular light, she added,
“Will ony ither body, Government or no Government,
get the peas and cabbage and taties out o’ <i>our</i>
garden?” for Bell was an active partner.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said I, “but it’s not <i>very</i> unlikely.”</p>

<p>“If I thocht that, I would neither plant nor sow
anither dreel—that I would not; and if you’ll take the
early taties I’ve cut, I’ll <i>sell</i> ye them. They’re a grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
kind, the auld early Dons,—grand growers, lots at
every shaw, and gude eaters,—nothing to beat them
for size and quality.”</p>

<p>I agreed to take Bell’s seed-potatoes, which partly
pacified her; but she came back on, “It’s no’ possible!
Leave the manse—na!” until I said that the Knowe
Park garden would need to be put right at once, that
it was very good soil, that I would be happy to buy all
her spare plants and seeds, and that she should still
keep the manse garden right, as there was no saying
what might happen.</p>

<p>Bell gave a qualified assent to this proposal: “She
would see; but she maun awa’ hame. She would
need to take something up with her;” the something
was a bunch of spunks (bits of thin split wood, very
dry, about six inches long, tipped with sulphur,
used for lighting candles and lamps, unknown now
that lucifer matches are so common) and a few pounds
of salt.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie looked in on me shortly after Bell had
left, and after a little general talk he quietly remarked
that the house—villa, he termed it—was getting on,
and that it looked a nice place. “Was I going to
build on the east side of the Knowe Park? Had I
any tenant in view? What would be the rent?
Would it be ready by Whitsunday—and dry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SHADOWS DEEPEN.</i></div>

<p>His manner and precision evinced something more
than mere friendly interest, and following as they did
so much in the train of Bell’s visit, I concluded that he
would “come out” if the Government did not yield.
It had been evident for some time that his sympathies
were with what was then called the “Evangelical”
party, although that name was by him considered
unfair to the other side, and he preferred calling it the
protesting party; but he had taken no prominent part
in the public discussions, and was scrupulously careful
about introducing ecclesiastical politics into his pulpit
ministrations. “The good seed is the Word of God,”
he would often say; “and as ordained to minister
to the souls of my parishioners, I try to preach it
faithfully, fully, and practically, avoiding controversy
of all kinds, political, ecclesiastical, theological, or
dogmatic. The only way to do real good, even in
opposing error or bigotry, is to preach the truth in
love.”</p>

<p>April had passed; May had covered the earth with
beauty, and blossom, and promise. Never did the
manse look so well, or its surroundings more delightful,
than on the evening before Mr. Barrie left for the
General Assembly in Edinburgh. I made an errand
to the manse, ostensibly to ask him to procure a
certain book for me when in town, but really to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
if I could pick up an inkling of his mind on the
Church controversy, and to offer to be of any service
in my power.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie and he were sauntering in the garden.
He was grave, and as they stopped opposite some
familiar flower, both seemed sad. Bell (a most
unusual thing for her) was stealthily eyeing them from
the kitchen window, having turned up the corner of
the little green-striped dimity under-screen. When
she saw me, she signalled me to meet her at the back
of the manse by jerking her thumb in that direction,
and added a slight trembling motion of her clenched
hand, to express further that she wanted me to do so
without Mr. and Mrs. Barrie’s knowing it. When I
reached the back court, there she was, and she at once
took speech in hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TOWN CLERK OF EPHESUS.</i></div>

<p>“Whatever’s gaun to happen, Mr. Martin? The
minister has been bundle-bundlin’ in the study for twa
or three days. Mrs. Barrie has been clearin’ oot auld
corners, or rather searchin’ into them, for there’s no’
much to clear out that’s either useless or lumbery.
Is’t possible we maun leave? It’s no’ possible. I’ve
a gude mind to speak to Mr. Barrie mysel’. Sir John
was here last night, and I heard him say as he gaed
through the lobby, ‘For all our sakes, for your own
sake, for your family’s sake, for the sake of the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of our fathers, for His sake who wishes all His people
to be one, think over the matter again before you
make a schism in His body. Carry out the good
doctrine you preached the other day when lecturing
on the town clerk of Ephesus, that we ‘ought to be
quiet, and do nothing rashly.’ Mr. Barrie only said,
‘Thank you, Sir John;’ but as he was coming ‘ben’
the lobby from seeing Sir John away, I took the
liberty o’ saying, ‘Sir John’s a clever man, a sensible
man, and he’s aye been our friend. So, sir, excuse me
for saying that I hope you will’—but I got no further;
I saw the tear was in Mr. Barrie’s e’e, and that fairly
upset me.” Then she added, “Will ye no’ speak till
him, Mr. Martin, seriously and firmly? Leave the
manse, and the kirk, and the garden!—I wadna
leave them if I was him, unless they sent a regiment
of dragoons.”</p>

<p>I said I would try. “Na,” said she, “ye maun
baith try’t and do’t too. He’s gaun to Edinburgh the
morn to the Assembly, and they say he’ll settle whether
to leave the Kirk or bide in’t before he comes back
here again.”</p>

<p>Leaving Bell, I came to the front of the manse, and
stood for a little admiring the scene. The evening
sun was about to set behind the western hills. Nature
was in her summer mantle of beauty and verdure,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
garden smiling at my feet; the fields beyond,
green, loamy, and rich; the stream glistering and
murmuring in the valley; the distant hills lighted up
with the evening glow; the clouds red, golden, and
grey, massed or straggling over the glorious sky. I
felt with Bell that to leave such a place was no easy
matter, and as I had given little attention to the
Church controversy, I was at a loss what to say. Mr.
and Mrs. Barrie observed me, and came forward.
After a quiet greeting, I said, “This is a lovely scene.
I find myself quoting from <i>Marmion</i>, ‘Who would not
fight for such a land?’”</p>

<p>I had given the quotation strongly; it startled Mr.
Barrie. He said softly and dreamily, as if speaking
to himself, “Without were <i>fightings</i>, within were
fears;” then looking me steadily in the face he said,
“I go to Edinburgh to-morrow,—a most eventful
journey for me and mine. In all probability I will
return disjoined from the Established Church of Scotland,
and no longer minister of the parish of Blinkbonny.
Excuse me, Mr. Martin, for feeling perplexed
and anxious.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL’S SUMMING UP.</i></div>

<p>Bell had by this time become a listener, having
crept forward very quietly. She <i>looked</i> at me with an
imploring face to speak out. I tried to say something,
but Mr. Barrie’s look was so calm and overpowering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
that I could only get out “that I dared not presume
to advise in the matter; that several of his people
would follow him if he did find it his duty to come
out; and that the Lord would provide.”</p>

<p>This was too much or rather too little for Bell, so
she joined the colloquy, addressing herself, however,
to me. “Maybe He will, if there’s a real need-be;
but what sense or religion either can there be in
leaving a kirk and manse provided for us already, and
where He has countenanced us and given us peace
and prosperity, for a chance o’ anither or maybe nane
at a’? I would see anither door opened first; as Sir
John said yestreen about the clerk o’ the toun o’
Ephesus, we should do nothing rashly. Think on
Mrs. Barrie an’ the bairns, and the garden and the
dumb craiturs, and,” looking at the churchyard,
she added softly, “wee Nellie.”</p>

<p>Bell had joined the party suddenly, and the above
sentence was finished by her almost in a breath. It
made Mr. Barrie wince. Mrs. Barrie saw this, and
at once left us; she got Bell to follow her, by saying
that doubtless Mr. Martin had business with Mr.
Barrie. Mrs. Barrie did her best to soothe Bell by
agreeing with her: “Yes, Bell, it will be a severe
trial to leave the manse.”</p>

<p>“And a terrible risk, too,” said Bell. “Oh, mem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
try and dinna let the maister do’t, at least no’ as
suddenly as he speaks of.”</p>

<p>“I leave Mr. Barrie entirely to the guidance of his
own conscience in the matter. If he goes, I go.”</p>

<p>“So will we a’, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bell,” said Mrs. Barrie thoughtfully, “we
may not be able to keep a servant. If we are, and
you are willing to go with us, you will be an immense
help to us all.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELL’S PARISH.</i></div>

<p>This overwhelmed Bell. Leaving the manse was
bad, but leaving the family was terrible; such a thing
had never entered her mind. Luckily the cow
“Daisy” began to low impatiently, which relieved
Mrs. Barrie of present embarrassment. Bell methodically
started for her milking-pail, muttering, “The
very coo’s no’ hersel’ the nicht, naether am I; I’m
behint time wi’ Daisy, and kye should be milkit
regular,”—which Bell set about with more than her
ordinary vigour, all the time speaking away to Daisy
about leaving the manse, and stiffly arguing the matter
with the cow. The cow did not seem quite to understand
her; she usually did, and answered Bell with
her meek eye and stolid face; but Bell’s <i>manner</i>
to-night was abrupt and excited, and Daisy had
probably more difficulty in comprehending the <i>matter</i>;
so she wagged one ear quickly, made sundry short,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>impatient shakes of her head, and stared intently at
Bell, but not with the usual signs of intelligent
concert. Daisy couldn’t make it out; neither, alas!
could Bell.</p>

<p>I did not go into the manse, although Mr. Barrie
asked me. I excused myself on the ground of his
requiring all the time at his disposal to prepare for
to-morrow’s journey, but said that many along with
myself would wait anxiously for the decision he might
make, and I asked him to give me as early intimation
of it as he conveniently could, assuring him that
I would be most happy to be of any service in my
power. He thanked me, and putting his arm in mine
walked slowly down the garden. As we passed between
its healthy crops and trim flower-beds, he said:</p>

<p>“This is Bell’s parish, and well tended it is. I’m
very sorry for Bell; it must be a severe trial to her—worthy,
honest, laborious Bell!”</p>

<p>We halted at the little wicket gate at the bottom of
the garden. There was a sad look on Mr. Barrie’s
face as he turned round and looked at the pleasantly
situated, snug manse. Memory seemed busy unfolding
her roll of bygone days. It had been the home of
his happy married life, the birthplace of his children.
Then he looked at the church: it had been the scene
of his labours, the joy of his heart, the place of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
ministry to the flock he loved. Then he looked at
the churchyard: there was one little spot specially
dear, but many others hallowed in his mind by
associations of the kind and good who lay there. So
absorbed was he by the reflections awakened by the
scene, that he seemed unconscious of my presence,
and as his eye travelled from object to object, he
spoke sadly and to himself, “Yes, beautiful for situation.—Thou
excellest them all.—Olive plants.—Where
prayer was wont to be made.—Watch-tower.—Pleasure
in her stones.—With Christ; far better.—We shall
not all sleep.” Then, as if awaking from a dream, he
said, “Excuse me, Mr. Martin; the old Adam is too
strong for young Melanchthon. Every human consideration
urges me to remain in the Church of
Scotland. I would exhaust every possible means for
the sake of all concerned to avert a disruption, but I
cannot, I dare not submit to see her rights infringed
or her prerogatives violated; it would be treason to
my Master. And bitter, bitter as the alternative is, I
will act as my conscience impels me (and I have
given the subject the devout consideration it demands),
and leave all, although I freely confess it is a sore
trial of my faith. I fear as I enter into the cloud.
I must walk by faith, not by sight.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EVE OF BATTLE.</i></div>

<p>There was a nobility, a display of true valour in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
attitude, tone, and expression that awed me. The fire
of his words kindled a flame in my heart, which
grew in intensity as he proceeded. When he had
finished he seemed as if he had been transfigured; his
sadness was gone; he looked like a knight challenging
a field of foemen. I could only grasp his hand and
stumble out, “The battle is the Lord’s; be of good
courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our
people and for the cities of our God, and the Lord do
that which is good in His sight.”</p>

<p>He returned the grasp very warmly, and said,
“Exactly; that text must be our motto. I thank you
for it. But I am detaining you. I will let you know
the result whenever declared; possibly I may be your
tenant at Knowe Park.” He said this with a pleasant
smile; and as we said good-night, I added, “Knowe
Park will be made as comfortable as I can make it,
although, had I expected such a tenant, I would have
made it better.”</p>

<p>“It’s perhaps as much as we’ll can afford,” said he
cheerfully half-way up the garden. “Good night
again.”</p>

<p>As I walked homeward I met Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland.
I knew him as a gentleman of the neighbourhood, and
had been in the habit of saluting him respectfully,
but had rarely spoken to him; I was therefore surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
when he said, “I called at the house, Mr.
Martin, but learning you were at the manse, I came
to meet you. Have you a spare half-hour? I wish
to see you particularly.”</p>

<p>“I am quite at your service, Sir John.”</p>

<p>“Then take a quiet turn down the road;” which we
did. Sir John then began:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIR JOHN M<sup>c</sup>LELLAND’S OPINIONS.</i></div>

<p>“Mr. Martin, I want a long talk with you about
Mr. Barrie. I know that you are very intimate with
him. I need not tell you that I esteem him very
highly. As a minister he has few equals, that we all
feel; he is, besides, a gentleman in every sense of the
word—a scholar, a man of culture, quite an acquisition
to the district. Then Mrs. Barrie is a most
delightful creature,—I do not know a more thorough
lady than she is; and they have a very nice family—very
nice children indeed—good-looking;—so they
may well be, considering their parents—the handsomest
couple in the parish, I may say in the county. But
<i>that</i> is by the bye. Well, the party in the Church
of Scotland that call themselves the ‘Evangelicals,’
as if they were the only true preachers of the gospel,—a
most unwarrantable and impertinent name for
any party to assume, or rather to <i>adopt</i>, for they
parade it so offensively that it betrays their former
orphanage, and they strut about in the plumes they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
have stuck on themselves, calling their opponents
‘Moderates,’ as if that were a term of contempt.
It would be more consistent if they’d let their moderation
be known to all men;—but <i>that</i> is by the
bye. Well, these schismatics and agitators—‘Evangelicals,’
if you like—have raised a hue-and-cry
about the Church in danger, and trampling on the
rights of the Christian people, and have pestered not
only the church courts, but the courts of law and
the Government of the country, by their pertinacious
intermeddling with time-honoured institutions and
the rights of proprietors. And so determined and
malignant are the leaders of this movement, that they
have dug out one or two exceptional cases (you know
the exception proves the rule), and dragged them
through the law courts, where they got ignominiously
beaten, because justice was administered impartially.
This has raised the ‘odium theologicum,’ the most
unreasonable and insatiable of all passions; and
instead of acting as law-abiding subjects and as
peacemakers, they are determined, if Government,
forsooth, will not yield to them, to break up the
Church of Scotland if they can! The law has been
clearly laid down by the judges of the land, but they
demand to be allowed to be a law to themselves.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HEAVY HITTING.</i></div>

<p>Here Sir John looked very indignant, then went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
in a calmer tone: “What I cannot understand is, that
ministers above all others should object to their own
rights being protected. The principal uproar has been
about some ministers who were appointed to parishes,
but the people would not receive them, and even the
presbytery refused to ordain them. Now, especially
in the Church of Scotland, every student before he is
licensed to preach the gospel has had a complete
college education, and several years’ training in the
divinity halls, and has undergone successfully very
searching examinations conducted by eminent professors,
and has, moreover, under presbyterial superintendence
gone at least creditably through trials for
licence, which included sermons on texts assigned to
him. Could anything further be desired as a safeguard
against unfit men being allowed to be ministers?
It is from such that the patron, who is generally the
largest proprietor in the parish, and has therefore the
greatest interest in it, must make a selection and
present a minister to a vacant parish church, not
unfrequently to the church in which he worships.
Well, these ‘Evangelicals’—ministers themselves, remember—wish
it to be in the power of the members
of a church (and you know what a mixture the
membership is, of all sorts and conditions—good and
indifferent, not to say bad) to reject the minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
appointed by the patron,—a minister trained as I
explained before,—and possibly from whim, or spleen,
or spite at the patron, to object to his settlement,
which can only be done by objecting to his preaching;
and to prove their case, I grieve to say, they do not
scruple at condemning his services as unedifying, or
uninteresting, or unintelligible (very likely to them), or
even unsound,—set them up for judges!—and do all in
their power to blast the minister’s prospects. Does it
not strike you, Mr. Martin, as something very strange
that ministers should desire to commit themselves to
such tribunals in preference to the existing ones?”</p>

<p>I was at a loss what to say and how to get out of
the difficulty, when Sir John began again with great
animation: “What they aim at seems to be a sort of
preaching competition, where the man who has the
knack of tickling the ears, or wheedling the affections,
or flattering the vanities of a congregation, would
certainly outweigh the man of more solid parts. The
result would be that young ministers would prepare
one or two <i>taking</i> sermons, and thereby secure
parishes; and what ought to be a congregation of
devout worshippers would become a congregation of
critics; and some fussy nobody, by dint of sheer
impertinence, would set himself—ay, even herself—up
as ‘grieved at the prospect of the incalculable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
injury to be done to the highest interests of the
parish,’ and with a long face say ‘she felt it her
duty, her bounden duty, her painful duty,’ and
stuff of that sort. Dissenting churches have oftener
split on the election of preachers than any other
thing, and bitter and disgraceful results have followed.
In such cases votes are counted, not weighed. I
know of a little insignificant ‘bodie,’—his neighbours
called him ‘Little Gab,’—a creature who was
in misery through his indolence and his intermeddling
with other folk’s affairs to the neglect of his own. He
was a Dissenter, and at the meetings for choosing a
minister in the chapel he went to, he chattered and
moved and objected and protested, and was so often
on his feet with his ‘Moderator, I move,’ ‘Moderator,
I object,’ ‘Moderator, by the forms of procedure,
page, etc.,’ that he provoked a smart word from one of
their best men every way—in education, position, and
judgment. This set the bodie fairly up, and although
he richly deserved more than he got, he spoke so glibly
that he saddled the church with a minister of whom
the late Dr. Hunter, on hearing his first sermon
after his ordination—generally a man’s best—said to
a friend as they came out of the church, ‘Ye’ll get
that ane to bury.’ But <i>that</i> is by the bye.”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>LITTLE GAB.</i></div>

<p>As Sir John now looked to me to say something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
I merely added, “That was like the doctor. I think
I know the church you refer to; Little Gab was a
waspish bodie.”</p>

<p>He at once resumed: “I am surprised that a man of
good sense and sound judgment like Mr. Barrie should
be misled by the noisy demagogues—many of them
otherwise good men, but on this subject perfect
fanatics. I spoke to him on the subject the other
night, but made no impression. Have you remonstrated
with him? Did he say anything on the
subject to you to-night?”</p>

<p>I told him what had passed at the manse. When
he heard of Mr. Barrie’s firm resolve, he said very
excitedly: “It’s utter folly—it’s sheer madness—it’s
social suicide, bringing ruin on his family for a mere
phantom of excited sentimentality! Let them stay in
the Church and use constitutional means to reform
abuses, if any exist. The Church of Scotland has had
an honoured past, and must have a glorious future.
They vowed to maintain and defend her; they are
trying to divide and weaken her. Can they not wait
patiently until events are ripe? Progress in a complicated
body such as a church is gradual, and should
be deliberate. The leaders of this movement are
principally men who have risen to ecclesiastical
eminence by their popular gifts. Not a few of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
fought bitterly against the Dissenters in the Voluntary
controversy (which, by the bye, seems shelved for
good and all; the pace was too quick to last), and
now they urge their brethren to secede if <i>their</i> absurd
demands are not immediately conceded. I much
doubt if the noisiest now will be the first to come out.
If they do, I would not wonder to see them the first
to rush back again, and change their ‘Retract! no,
not a hair’s-breadth!’ into a breakneck stampede, in
which they will crush past their deluded followers,
and whine pitifully for pardon and <i>place</i>. The State
has treated them well, too well, and is entitled to
have its conditions fulfilled. They want the pay and
the place, but kick at the terms—wish these all one-sided;
and when the law steps in with quiet dignity
and strict justice to protect the rights of proprietors,
ministers, and people alike, and to insist on these
being administered according to express statute, the
men who vowed to abide by the law either set it at
nought, or demand its subservience to their revolutionary
ideas. They wish liberty without control,
privileges without conditions, and power to exercise
despotism without appeal. And because they cannot
get it,—because they should not get it,—because,
having respect to the welfare alike of Church and
State, they must not get it, they keep crying out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
about tyranny and treason, and ‘spiritual independence,’
and what not.”</p>

<p>Sir John paused for a little, and I thought he had
finished, but something seemed to strike him, and he
at it again:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VIALS OF WRATH.</i></div>

<p>“By the bye, these folks call themselves the Non-Intrusion
party. Was ever name so outrageously
violated? Is a proprietor an intruder on his own
estate? Only a desperate poacher would say yes.
Is a man an intruder in his own house? None but
a burglar would think so. Is a mother an intruder in
her own nursery? Only a vile and cruel nurse,
caught in the act of ill-treating the children, would
have the audacity to conceive of such a monstrous
anomaly. Yet these intruding non-intrusionists say
to the State that fostered them and supports them,
and that only wishes to have its fundamental principles
respected, like the poacher, ‘Be off! you have
no right here;’ like the burglar, ‘I want this, and
will have it by hook or by crook’—crook should be
put first; and like the nurse, ‘Get out of this
nursery! you have no business here. I’ll do what I
like, and if you oppose me I’ll take the children away
from you.’ I may be carried away by the strong
convictions that force themselves on me as I consider
the whole proceedings, the wily, oily sophisms of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
non-intrusionists; but excuse me, Mr. Martin, for saying
that they should take Judas for their patron, and
Herod the king—any of the Herods they like—for
their foster-brother.”</p>

<p>Sir John seemed to feel that he had gone too far,
and excused himself for being so bitter. He was a
confirmed Tory, and began about “vote-voting, everything
was vote-voting now-a-days since that Reform Bill
had passed. Give some men a vote in Kirk or State,
and they became self-conceited, consequential creatures.
The more they are canvassed, the more unbearable
they get. But <i>that</i> is by the bye. I presume you
are a Whig, Mr. Martin, so we’ll not meddle politics
to-night. Then you really think Mr. Barrie will
‘come out’?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it, Sir John. Mr. Walker of Middlemoor
and he start for Edinburgh early to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIR JOHN’S VERDICT.</i></div>

<p>“Mr. Walker!” said Sir John; “he’s a quiet, peaceable
man; he’ll not be led away by any Will-o’-the-wisp.
He’ll smoke over it, and think over it, and
come back parish minister of Middlemoor as heretofore.
I’m glad that Mr. Walker is going with Mr.
Barrie; he’ll give him the common-sense, considerate
view of the question—especially the home view, the
family and fireside interest, which seems entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
ignored. Should a secession take place, there will
be a sad awakening when too late to the meaning of
these words: ‘If any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith and is worse than an infidel,’—worse than an
infidel—worse!” Then, after a pause of a few seconds,
he said, “I’m sorry, very sorry for Mr. Barrie; if it
were possible to be angry with such a man, I feel
angry—certainly at his conduct, or rather his intentions.
But I’m glad Mr. Walker goes with him. I
am member of Assembly for a royal burgh, and intend
going in the day after to-morrow; I’ll set Mr. Walker
on Mr. Barrie.” Then looking at his watch, he said,
“It’s getting late; do you think it would be of any
use for me to see Mr. Barrie to-night? The fact
is, I cannot rest over this matter—it’s too—too—too
dreadful altogether.”</p>

<p>I hinted as politely as I could that I thought
nothing would shake Mr. Barrie’s resolve. Sir John
said “he feared as much, but he would see Mr.
Walker and other friends, and try to <i>save</i> Mr. Barrie
from”—here he hesitated, repeating, “from—from—well,
I cannot get a better word—ruin to himself and
his family—certain ruin.” He shook hands frankly
with me, hoped he had not kept me too long, and
promised to let me know how matters went; and as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
said good night, he looked towards the manse and
said, “I cannot get Mr. Barrie and his family out of
my head,” then started homewards.</p>

<p>Late as it was, I went to see the new house and
garden at Knowe Park. I had urged on the tradesmen,
and it was all but finished and <i>drying</i> nicely. The
garden had received special attention. Except immediately
around the new house, it had not been interfered
with; and as it was stocked with good fruit-trees
and bushes in the days of the old house, these
only required trimming and pruning. Bell’s cut
potatoes and spare plants were further forward than
those in the manse garden. When I got home it took
a long time to tell Agnes the events of the night.
Both of us were puzzled as to whether Mr. Barrie or
Sir John was right—we rather inclined to Sir John’s
notion of patience and prudence; and whilst we
admired Mr. Barrie’s noble resolution, we, especially
Agnes, spoke of “whatever was to become of Mrs.
Barrie and the dear bairns?” and did not see through
it at all.</p>

<p class="drop-cap-s">SIR JOHN had written to his steward to tell me
that Mr. Barrie had left the Established Church;
the steward showed me the letter; it was a compound
of amazement, sympathy, and anger.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he finished, when Bell, evidently in a
state of great excitement, came in and said, “Eh, Mr.
Martin, it’s ower true; we’ll hae to flit! Mr. Barrie’s
gi’en up the kirk, and he has nae richt noo to the
manse. I canna tell exactly when we’ll be putten
out, but the mistress says we’ll no’ be allowed to bide
lang. I wadna like to be the Government that put
Mr. Barrie out o’ house and ha’. Some Mordecai will
rise ere lang to gi’e us relief, or some Nehemiah to
speak to the king and queen about the desolation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
affliction and reproach. Them that comes to pit us out
will maybe find an enemy in the garden, like Ahab in
Naboth’s vineyard. What’s the world comin’ till?”</p>

<p>Sir John’s steward knew Bell well, and tried to
soothe her by saying, “Don’t bother yourself. If Mr.
Barrie adhered to his resolution to leave the Established
Church, no one would presume to hurry him out of
the manse; at all events, he could have it until a
successor was appointed.”</p>

<p>But Bell was not in a sociable mood, and only said,
“Sooner or later we maun flit.” Then handing me a
letter from Mr. Barrie, she said she would step into
the kitchen until I got it read, and wait to see if
there was any answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KNOWE PARK.</i></div>

<p>The letter confirmed the steward’s news, and
stated it would be a favour if I would reserve for
him the first offer of Knowe Park, and that he would
be home as soon as possible. After the steward had
left I went to Bell, and told her that Mr. Barrie’s letter
was about Knowe Park, and asked if she would come
with me and see if it would suit. This was rather a
sudden following up of the affair, as Bell had convinced
herself that Mr. Barrie would never leave the
manse; and although she had generally ended her remarks
on the subject with “Wherever could we gang?”
she had not tried to answer the question. After a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
little hesitation she said, “Knowe Park! that’s where
Mr. Taylor lived,—he had a grand apple tree—an
‘Oslin pippin.’ Is’t aye yonder? It’s a nice garden—a
nice place to stop. I’ve noticed them buildin’ a
new house there, but I haena paid muckle attention
till’t. I wad like to see’t. I’ll be very glad to gang.”
And off we set.</p>

<p>It took a very few minutes to go. Bell was
pleased with the outside of the house. “It was a
nice house—fine big windows—faced the south—wad
hae a grand view—the garden was bigger than she
thocht, and in gude order. Is thae my plants?—they
were thrivin’.” With such snatches did Bell accompany
her survey of the place before she went into the
house. She criticized the inside more minutely, her
standard being the manse. As she went from room
to room she spoke of each, or rather thought aloud:
“This is the kitchen—it’s very nice—lichtsome—plenty
o’ room—it looks a nice grate, or I fancy
ye’ll ca’ that a range. I never tried them, but they
say they’re handy. Presses—pantry. What’s ben
here?—washing-house—coal-house—awmrie<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—bedroom.
Very nice; this will do fine. Noo, what about
a study?” I suggested a bedroom, but she gave that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>only a partial approval; the other rooms pleased her.
When I showed the drawing-room, “Drawing-room!”
said she; “we hae nane at the manse, and Mrs. Barrie
thinks we get on fine without it. We’ll make this
the study. But what about the outhouses?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The old Scotch name for the store-room containing dry food, such
as flour, meal, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>This exercised Bell greatly. There was an old
building in the north corner of the place, behind the
bleaching-green, which I had left as it was; it was
a compound of stable, hay-loft, cart-shed, fruit-room,
and potato-house, but required considerable repair. I
was undecided whether to repair it or replace it by
a building more in keeping with the house, but Bell
protested against new outhouses. “Na, na; nae mair
expenses. Whitewash it, gi’e it a bit sort up, and
it will fit us exactly.” Then going to the hedge on
the east, she said, “Wha’s aught this park?”</p>

<p>“It goes with the house,” said I, “and is at Mr.
Barrie’s service.”</p>

<p>Bell was delighted: she saw her way to bring
“Daisy” and the hens. She became quite cheerful,
and left me, saying as she parted, “It’s the very place
for us. I wadna say it’s just up to the manse, but I’m
thankfu’ to ken of such a gude hame for them among
kent folk ‘Better a wee bush than nae bield,’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as the
saying is. But it’s no’ wee either; it’s just real nice.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MR. BARRIE’S RETURN.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Barrie’s return was awaited by the folks of
Blinkbonny with mingled feelings, uppermost being
anxiety about his worldly prospects. They were
hardly prepared for the Disruption; and when they
learned that Mr. Barrie had disjoined himself from
the Church of Scotland, and consequently from his
only source of income hitherto, they spoke of it as
a serious matter, a very serious matter. It looked a
rash step, and they felt more than they said, for
the thought of his family and their future support
pressed heavily on their hearts, and made his friends
silent and solemn. He reached home on Thursday
afternoon, and felt at a loss how to act. A few of
his elders and friends had had little meetings on
the subject, but these were unsatisfactory, because
every one had nearly the same want of opinion.
“They really did not know what to do;” “What
could they do?” was all they could say, followed by
a shake of the head and a puzzled look at one
another. When they learned that Mr. Barrie had
got back, they debated whether to wait for <i>him</i> to
propose a meeting, or to go to him. The majority
recommended that some of their number should call
at the manse; but each wished his neighbour to go,
and all were reluctant.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Taylor, a worthy elder and a sterling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
man, said: “Friends, it will never do to back out
that way. It’s unkind to Mr. Barrie, and it’s not
creditable to ourselves. If three or four of you will
join me,” and looking round the company, he nodded
to each as he named,—“say Mr. Smith, and Mr.
Watson, and Mr. Brown, and Mr. Martin,—we’ll go,
and go soon.”</p>

<p>This met with universal approval, and a letter was
sent to let Mr. Barrie know that some friends would
wait on him about seven o’clock, if convenient. The
reply was cordial and touching. It conveyed his
heartfelt thanks for “the prompt kindness that provided
for him so thoughtfully the earliest possible
opportunity of explaining his position, and conferring
with them on the important events of the past week,”
and expressed the pleasure he would have in seeing
all that could conveniently come, whether they approved
of the step he had taken or not.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TANFIELD HALL.</i></div>

<p>This letter removed the objection that many felt
about going to the manse, and the company filled
the dining-room. We expected to find Mr. Barrie
dejected and downcast, and were surprised to find him
not only cheerful, but more demonstrative in his
heartiness than usual. How to introduce the matter
had puzzled the deputation. This was not needed.
Mr. Barrie very fully, but in moderate language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
stated the case as between the Free Church, the
Government, and the remaining ministers of the
Established Church, making it appear very different
to me from what Sir John had made it. None of
us ever saw him so animated as when he described
the meeting of the Assembly from which, after the
Protest and Declaration was made, hundreds of ministers
walked out for conscience’ sake; the perplexed
look of the remaining members of Assembly; the
awe-struck, solemn silence of the crowd as the line
of reverend and grave men became longer and yet
longer; the tumult of joy and sorrow as they crowded
into Tanfield Hall; the reception they got from
ministers of other denominations and the Christian
public. As, however, these are fully described in
the chronicles or annals of the times, I will not
repeat them here, but would commend the subject to
the attention of the student of history, and of the
Scotch people, whichever side of the questions in
dispute they may favour.</p>

<p>When he had laid the case before us, Mr. Barrie
with great earnestness said, “I wish no one to join
the Free Church, for”—here he hesitated, and looked
as if debating something with himself, then resumed,
“for—for—well, excuse me for using the term, for
my sake. I wish every man to act only on distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
conviction; and, if I know myself at all, I consider
the right of private judgment in such matters such
a holy thing, that I will respect those who, on conviction,
differ from me on this matter, as much as I
will those who go along with me in it. And now,
Christian friends, I leave the matter in your hands.
Consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.</i></div>

<p>A long, impressive silence followed Mr. Barrie’s
remarks. The deputation looked down, then up, then
at one another. At length Mr. Taylor said: “Gentlemen,
ye’ve heard Mr. Barrie—I can answer for
myself—with great satisfaction. I’ve been reading
the <i>Merqry</i>” (an Edinburgh newspaper called the
<i>Caledonian Mercury</i>) “and the <i>Scotsman</i> on this
matter—thanks to Mr. Smith for it. I’ve mair time
for readin’ than I once had, and I never was prouder
o’ my country than when I read that abune<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> four
hunder ministers had courage enough, and faith
enough, and principle enough, to leave the Kirk when
they saw that her birthricht was wrested frae her
by the sec’lar power, and their consciences scandaleez’d
by open defiance to the fundamental principles
of the Christian economy. I needna tell you, gentlemen,
that this leaving o’ the Kirk means loss o’
house and ha’, and way o’ livin’, or stipend as it’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>ca’d; an’ nae doubt there’s a sair heart in mony a
minister’s breast, when he thinks o’ his family and
them that depends on him. And nae wonder, for in
that respect it’s a step in the dark,—a’ the eerier
that he has his nearest and dearest on his back,
and a wrang step might finish them a’.” Here Mr.
Barrie winced, and emitted a sudden sound as if
cold water had been poured on his back, which led
Mr. Taylor to change his graphic style to one of
practical application. “But no’ to detain ye, gentlemen,
I for one side wi’ the Free Kirk, and will
dae all in my power to back Mr. Barrie; and I
hope and trust that the world’ll see that Scotland
hasna lost the Covenanter’s spirit yet, and will countenance
what I may ca’ the martyrs o’ her third
Reformation, that have gi’en up sae much for their
Maister’s sake, and never let them want a ‘competent
portion of the good things of this life.’ ‘Bear ye
one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of
Christ.’”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Above.</p>

</div>

<p>Others expressed themselves to the same effect.
The oldest man in the party, George Brown, verging
on eighty years of age, a “Nathanael,” after a few
words said, “Mr. Barrie, and Christian friends, I
propose that we renew the Covenant.” He made the
same proposal in one of the early Assemblies, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his weak voice, and the unexpectedness and inexpediency
of the motion, prevented its being taken up.</p>

<p>It was resolved, on Mr. Barrie’s suggestion, to call
a meeting of the parishioners for Saturday afternoon,
so that he might have an opportunity of explaining
the “Disruption” fully to all who would meet with
him, and to let the meeting be known in the parish,
so that there might be a good attendance. Mr. Barrie
also said that, as he considered it inexpedient to
conduct the Sabbath service in the (he called it for
the first time) “old” church, he would on Sabbath
preach on the Annie Green, a nice grassy common,
with its banks sloping upwards in a fairly-sized semicircle,
formed at a bend of the burn.</p>

<p>Before leaving the manse there was a service. The
daylight had begun to fade; Mr. Barrie said that on
that account we would sing what we all knew so
well as not to need books, the 2d Paraphrase. As
he read it, his voice faltered, and there was not a
dry eye, or a throat without a lump in it, as it
was sung. I give it in full below, although it must
be familiar to nearly all of my readers, leaving them
to judge of its singular applicability to the case:</p>

<p>The prayer was impressive and devout, fervent in
its cry for light and strength and grace, simple and
reverent.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>GEORGE BROWN.</i></div>

<p>After leaving the manse, the deputation walked
slowly down the approach, old George Brown leaning
on Mr. Taylor’s arm. When we reached the gate
opening on the public road, George, who was in front,
turned about, and when all had gathered round him,
he said:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ALL THE TITHES.</i></div>

<p>“Freends, I’m an auld man, the auldest o’ ye a’,
and I thank God I’ve lived to see this day. I’ve
lang mourned o’er the backslidings and defections o’
our times, but the Lord has made bare His holy
arm. This is the day of His merciful visitation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
I’ll say to you as Moses said to Joshua, ‘Be strong
and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
them: for the Lord thy God, He it is that doth go
with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee;
fear not, neither be dismayed.’ Dinna turn your
back in the day of battle, like the sons of Ephraim;
dinna abide by the bleatings of the sheep, like
Reuben, or remain in ships, like Dan; abune a’,
dinna provoke the curse of Meroz for not coming
to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Mind,
when things werena as they should have been in
the days o’ Haggai, when men lived in their ceiled
houses and let the house o’ the Lord lie waste, that
they sowed much but brocht in little, when neither
their meat nor their drink nourished them, and even
their vera claes werena warm. Their wages were
putten into a bag wi’ holes, and the Lord blew on
what did grow; an’ the drouth<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> spoilt their corn, an’
wine, an’ oil, an’ men, an’ cattle, an’ a’ the labour
o’ their hands; and they had blastin’, an’ mildew, an’
hail. But frae the vera day, the four-and-twentieth
day o’ the ninth month, even from the day that the
foundation o’ the Lord’s temple was laid—frae that
vera day the Lord blessed them wi’ plenty, an’
scattered their faes, and made them as a signet—that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>I take to be a finger-ring, aye in His sicht. We
hae gude reason to believe that the Lord’s time to
favour Zion has come. He’s sitting like a refiner of
silver, purifying the sons of Levi. Dinna rob Him
in tithes and offerings, or He’ll curse us wi’ a curse;
but oh, my freends, bring a’ the tithes into the store-house,—the
tithe o’ pious hearts and godly zeal, an’
prayer, an’ brotherly love, an’ charity, an’ works o’
faith, an’ labours o’ love, and worldly goods—a’ the
tithes; dinna keep back pairt o’ the price, as ye
would escape the fate o’ Ananias and Sapphira. And
if we a’ dae our pairt, the Lord will prove true to
His promise, an’ open the windows o’ heaven, and
pour out a blessing till there’s no room to receive
it; and ours will be a delightsome land—no more
desolate and forsaken, but Hephzibah and Beulah,
which means ‘Delighted in,’ and ‘Married.’”</p>

</div>

<p>There was something of the old prophet in the good
man, as he “lifted up his voice and testified.” An
interesting conversation followed, in which present
duty was discussed, and each resolved to help the
good cause. Before leaving the avenue, under the
shade of the two limes which graced its entrance,
without previous concert, but as if moved by a simultaneous
influence, we uncovered and <i>looked to</i> old
George. He quite understood the look, and feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the impulse, he engaged in prayer. His words had
the rich unction of Christian experience; they lifted
us up for the time until we felt as if inside the
audience-chamber; he spoke as one speaks to a father
and friend; it was not wrestling, it was more like
Hezekiah’s spreading out the letter of the Assyrian
captain before the Lord in the temple. The close of
the prayer for light and direction was fervent,—that
every one of us may ask, “Lord, what wilt Thou have
me to do?” and do it with all our might, as good
soldiers, and good servants, and good stewards. During
the prayer was heard an occasional “amen,” and there
was a unanimous “amen” at its close, a very uncommon
thing in such exercises in Scotland.</p>

<p>All had shaken hands with George, and were
bidding good-bye to each other, when George said:
“My freends, I’m gaun to ask a favour. I am a
descendant of John Brown o’ Priesthill, the carrier
that was shot by Claverhouse. I hae his Bible and
Psalm-book, and table and arm-chair. I wad like
them to be used at the Annie Green on Sabbath by
Mr. Barrie. They hae served the same purpose wi’
Cameron and Peden and MacMillan in the covenantin’
times, and I think the blood o’ the martyrs is noo
springing into the seed of the Church.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the unanimous reply.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTICE of the meeting that had been resolved
on in the manse was given in the village
and parish, chiefly by one telling another of it;
and so effectively was this done, that not a few
who had given the day to the work of announcing it,
felt disappointed at finding the news had preceded
them.</p>

<p>Before the hour of meeting there was an unusual
bustle in the streets, even for a Saturday, and the
folks seemed all to have on their Sabbath-day clothes.
As soon as the doors of the Beltane Hall, the public hall
of Blinkbonny, were opened, a stream of people flowed
into it, leaving the streets with scarcely a human
being on them. Mr. Barrie entered very fully into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the history of the “Ten Years’ Conflict.” He was
calm, self-possessed, and impressive. His references
to the opposite side were marked by caution and
Christian courtesy. When speaking of himself, he did
so with great modesty; but he was high in his praise
of the leaders of the movement, and of the determined
attitude they maintained against all interference with
the rights of the Christian people, for these alone were
the true Christian Church. He pressed on the attention
of all the duty of considering prayerfully the
whole question; that they should not be influenced by
any motive of mere human friendship or partiality
or partisanship, but should bring the light of Scripture
and conscience to bear on the path of duty, and walk
in it and along it through good and bad report.</p>

<p>Before concluding, he thanked them all for their
presence and manifest attention to his statement, and
most touchingly for all their loving kindnesses to him:
“As the minister of the Established Church of Blinkbonny,
I must now say to you ‘Farewell,’ but I
fervently add the prayer, ‘The God of peace be with
you.’ By whatever distinctive name the Churches to
which we shall henceforth belong may be called, may
we all be members of the ‘Church of the firstborn,
whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life,’
and be found in Him here, complete in Him, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
ever with Him yonder; and as we have this hope in
us, let us, as far as we are agreed, walk by the same
rule, mind the same thing, and live at peace one with
another.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RING IN THE NEW.</i></div>

<p>He then told that he did not feel himself at liberty
to occupy his old pulpit next day; that as far as he
knew, no one had been appointed to preach in it; but
that he would preach on the green by the burn-side
at the usual hour in the forenoon, and at six o’clock
in the evening. And he hoped his <i>former</i> (with a slight
hesitation on his part, and a responsive sigh from the
meeting) congregation would join in the service, and
not be deterred by the fear that their presence would
be construed as committing them to his views of the
Church question. No such conclusion would be drawn.
He would endeavour by God’s help to preach the
gospel. Let them come to hear <i>it</i>, not him. He also
expressed a willingness to answer any questions, or
give further explanations, or to confer with any who
might prefer a private interview.</p>

<p>There was a long silence; at length old George
Brown rose and said: “My friends, it’s Saturday nicht.
Mr. Barrie’s haen a sair week, an’ doubtless mony o’
ye hae come here this day upon account o’ the occasion,
when but for it ye wad hae been at hame at
your proper duties; and ye’ll a’ hae to get things weel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
forrit<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to get to ordinances the morn, so I think
we’ll be maist in the way o’ our duty if we think weel
aboot what we’ve heard, and meditate on it.” Then
looking round the audience, he asked, “What say ee,
my friends?” As there was no reply, George looked
to Mr. Barrie, and said, “I think, sir, ye should
just conclude wi’ praise and prayer; and if I may
venture, I would say, gie oot the Forty-third Psalm
an’ the 3d verse. If we all sing the first four lines
frae the <i>heart</i>, there will be a time o’ refreshin’ the
morn.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="leftnote"><i>READIN’ THE LINE.</i></div>

<p>George was unmarried, and lived by himself. He
was in the constant practice of making worship aloud
and alone, reading each verse singly and then singing
it. He, without waiting for Mr. Barrie “giein’ out”
the psalm, and as if quite forgetful of his presence,
started to sing it to the tune called “Bedford,” which
the audience very heartily joined in. At the close
of the first verse George held up one hand to
secure silence, and repeated in singing tone on one
key the next verse,—what my older readers will
remember as “reading the line,”—which was then sung,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>and so on to the end of the psalm. George was then
proceeding to close his eyes for the prayer, after having
made a slight bow to Mr. Barrie; but Mr. Barrie said,
“Lead our devotions, if you please, Mr. Brown;” and
the old man did this so as to make every heart thrill,
and many strong men sob, and all the women cry.
I was too much agitated to be able to carry away
much. I am sorry to confess that the bit I can best
recall is not the most impressive and solemn part, but
rather a bit memorable for its quaintness as a specimen
of the prayers of the earlier days of the old worthies:
“That all who on the coming Sabbath assemble in the
courts of Thy house may be delivered from formality,
and legality, and carnality, purged from the leaven of
malice and wickedness, and prepared according to the
preparation of the sanctuary; ... and that all Thy
sent servants may be ministers of the true tabernacle,
which the Lord pitched, and not man, and may be as
the he-goats before the flocks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie pronounced the benediction, but the
audience seemed unwilling to break up. At length
old George stepped forward and shook Mr. Barrie’s
hand, wishing him “the blessing of him that was
separated from his brethren.” This proved contagious:
every one shook hands with Mr. Barrie; even Bell,
who had been trying to keep herself concealed during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the meeting, forgot her reserve, and although she broke
down immediately after, and sobbed bitterly, she kept
saying between the sobs, “The arrow of the Lord’s
deliverance;—the bush burning but not consumed;—the
five loaves and the two small fishes.”</p>

<p>As she went out, old George Brown was at her side,
and everybody that could get near him was shaking
his horny hands. He had overheard Bell saying,
“It is good for us to be here.” George knew Bell
well, and taking her hand he said, “Yes, Bell, ’deed
is’t. Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like
the chariots of Amminadab.” Then looking heavenwards:
“Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return,
that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in
the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
armies—or, as it’s in the margin, Mahanaim, the
place where the angels met Jacob on his way back to
Canaan, and Jacob said, ‘This is God’s host, and he
called the name of that place Mahanaim.’”</p>

<p>One subject filled every heart on the way homewards.
There was little said; they mused, and the
fire burned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BELLMAN’S DILEMMA.</i></div>

<p>Sabbath morning brought promise of a lovely summer
day, and the promise was not belied. Gavin
Sinclair, or “Guy,” now the full beadle, sexton, bellman,
and minister’s man of Blinkbonny, was in a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
of great perplexity. Annie Gawdie, who cleaned the
church, had told him that just as she was finished on
Saturday night, everybody came “troopin’ into the kirk
to take awa’ their books, an’ spoke o’ coming in soon
to take away their cushions and stools; that they had
made a bonnie mess o’ her clean kirk, and when she
quarrelled them for it, they said there was to be nae
kirk in the morn, but Mr. Barrie was to preach on the
Annie Green.”</p>

<p>Guy had not gone to the meeting. He was a
cautious man, and “didna think it became the like o’
him, being a man in a public capacity, to meddle wi’
kirk quarrels; for although Mr. Barrie micht leave
the kirk,—the mair’s the pity, for we’ll no’ soon get
ane like him, if ever,—there was the kirkyard. Ane
didna ken how soon they micht hae to break the
gr’und for some death or anither in the parish. He
didna like to gi’e offence to ony side—he had to look
till his bread,” etc.</p>

<p>Guy’s difficulty was whether to ring the church
bell or not. He always rung it at ten o’clock, and
would do that as usual,—“That wasna the bell for
gaun to the kirk—it was just to let folk ken the richt
time to set their clocks by.” His “swither” was
about the ringing of the bell for calling the folk to
the kirk at the usual time. If, as he learned, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
“was to be no sermon in the kirk, what for should he
ring the bell? Then, on the ither hand, what business
had he to stop the ringing o’ the bell without orders?
and wha was to direct him? Would he ask Mr.
Barrie, or the schoolmaster, who was session-clerk?
He never did that before, and it would look officious.”
So he resolved to go on as usual. He rang
the bell at ten o’clock, and sauntered, as was his
wont, to the manse to ask if there were any orders
for him, such as to make preparations for a baptism;
but instead of going into the kitchen, he hovered
about the door until Bell observed him. Bell was full
of activity to get all ready that she might go to the
Annie Green, and had forgotten about Guy’s regular
call. Both were perplexed. Guy muttered, he wondered
if there “would be ony orders for him the day—she
micht ask the minister—if—if he—if he had
ony—ony special—” Then a happy idea seemed to
strike him, and he got out—“onything to get ready
before bell-time?”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>GUY’S DECISION.</i></div>

<p>Bell took in the situation at once, but had not time
to master it. Generally the pulpit Bible and Psalm-book
were put on the parlour table on Sabbath mornings,
ready for Guy, and Bell got instructions about
anything specially wanted. They were not on the
table, but in the study, which Bell never entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
before church time. She asked Mrs. Barrie, who
answered that there could be nothing. Bell lingered,
and said in a distant tone, “I think, mem, that
Guy disna ken whether to ring the bell at kirk-time
or no’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie hesitated a little whether to disturb
Mr. Barrie or not, then said, “Tell Guy to please
himself; that Mr. Barrie left no orders, and I cannot
disturb him at present, but will ask him at half-past
eleven and let Guy know what he says.”</p>

<p>At half-past eleven, as usual, Mrs. Barrie tapped at
the study door, and said, “Now, my dear.” Mr. Barrie
almost immediately came out, and she asked him about
the bell, lifting up at the same time the simple
Geneva pulpit gown worn by Presbyterian ministers,
to help him on with it. Mr. Barrie did not turn and
stoop a little as usual to get the robe of office put on,
but kept saying,</p>

<p>“Bell—ring the bell—I had not thought of that.
What do you think, Mary?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie said she had told Guy to do as he
thought fit, unless he got other instructions,—“the
best thing that could have been done in the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Guy did ring the bell as usual, and got a neighbour
to tell any who came that the service was to be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the Annie Green. The herald, however, had little to
do. A few slipped quietly into the church for their
pew Bibles; some paid their weekly visit to the graves
of their loved ones around the church; but the stream
was towards the Annie Green. About a dozen male
figures stood around the church door when the bell
ceased; the stream had passed; not a straggler was
in the churchyard. After a general conversation they
broke up; some went to the Annie Green, others
moodily and wonderingly homewards.</p>

<p>I had arranged with George Brown to get his
ancestor’s chair, table, and books brought to my place
on Saturday evening, and persuaded him to stay with
me till Monday. I had also told Mr. Barrie about
them. The incident pleased him, and touched him
not a little. All forms, chairs, and available seats
were brought by willing hands to the Annie Green
early in the forenoon. The Priesthill relics were placed
nearest the burn, the forms and chairs in front, and
the dry grassy braes of the burn, which at the place
had the form of an irregular half-circle sloping gently
upwards, afforded comfortable room for a large congregation.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>UNDER THE OPEN CANOPY.</i></div>

<p>Long before the hour of meeting, the country folks
began to come in, going from “strength to strength.”
Many lingered about the old church and churchyard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and on the road or sward leading to the place of
meeting. Mr. Barrie left the manse in time to walk
leisurely. His plain black Geneva gown, his handsome
figure, his</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Aspect manly, grave, and sage.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As on king’s errand come,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>gave solemnity to the scene. Mrs. Barrie leant on
his arm. Each led one of the younger children by the
hand, whilst Bell followed with the two older ones.
As soon as they entered the avenue, the word, “There
he is—there they are,” passed from lip to lip; and
when they came to the public road, and as they
walked along it, the people stepped aside and stood
hat in hand till they had passed, then falling in
behind, formed an irregular procession to the green.
Those who had already gathered there all rose up and
uncovered as Mr. Barrie appeared. When the audience
had got seated or settled, Mr. Barrie opened the
service by reading the 125th Psalm, which he did in
a firm, clear voice. The braes of the burn, the glen,
the neighbouring woods, and for a considerable distance
the country around, heard the sound of grave,
sweet melody, rising in volume and intensity as it
proceeded. The tune was “St. Andrew’s,” an old
favourite, and said by tradition to be associated in
early Scottish Reformation times with the same words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent2">From henceforth and for aye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GRAVE, SWEET MELODY.</i></div>

<p>All the services were impressive, but I will not
attempt to detail them. The text was, “Jesus Christ,
the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.” The
sermon was, in the opinion of all, the best sermon
they had ever heard from him. George Brown was
delighted with it—characterized it as “a feast of fat
things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined;”
and all the more so that Mr. Barrie’s practice had
hitherto been to have his carefully prepared manuscript
before him when preaching, and to use it occasionally,
while on this occasion all that he had was the open
Priesthill Bible. The only objection that George ever
had to Mr. Barrie was that he used “the paper;” read
sermons were, according to George, neither good for
minister nor people. To-day there was nothing to mar
George’s enjoyment of the worship. The concluding
paraphrase was sung with even more enthusiasm. It
was the 48th Paraphrase, verses 6–9; the tune was
“Montrose,” sometimes called “the burghers’ rant.”
I give it in full, as I did the one sung in the manse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and my readers can imagine the vigour with which
such words were sung in such a meeting at such a
crisis:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who then can e’er divide us more</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">He loves us to the last.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not the least surprising of the forenoon’s incidents
was the amount of the collection. It had
been debated whether there should be any made on
the occasion, but Mr. Taylor was most determined to
have one. “Bring an offering with you,” said he, “is
as plain a command as, Come into His courts;” and
he undertook to provide and to stand at “<i>the plates</i>,”
which were placed just inside the gate of the Annie
Green. The result surprised Mr. Taylor. I have since
learned that many borrowed of their neighbours, and
that the amount put in as the congregation retired was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
larger than that made as they entered. The sum was
£29, 13s. 3d.</p>

<p>George, of course, took dinner with us, and a few
country friends joined who wished to be at the evening
service. I had been struck with the worn
appearance of the knees of George’s clothes compared
with the fresh “nap” on the other parts; but I
observed that, when asking a blessing before meat, and
returning thanks after it, he rubbed his hands firmly
over his knees, moving his body backwards and
forwards, and speaking louder as he began the forward
motion. His exercises were longer than are usual in
such cases, and I found on further acquaintance with
him that they were stereotyped, generally containing,
“May we go up through the wilderness of this world,
leaning on the staff of Him who is the beloved of our
souls. May we sit under His shadow with great
delight, and find His fruit sweet unto our taste. Bless
and sanctify all Thy ways and dealings towards us,” etc.
When remarking on the sermon, he also rubbed his
knees and discoursed rather than conversed about it.</p>

<p>The evening service was better attended than the
forenoon one. The burst of music was overpowering
as the 46th Psalm was being sung:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“God is our refuge and our strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In straits a present aid,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>FREE-WILL OFFERINGS.</i></div>

<p>The sermon was from these words, “Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all
these things shall be added unto you.” It was a
grand sermon, suitable for all times. At the close,
in a few moderately worded sentences, Mr. Barrie
referred to the special circumstances under which they
had met, and stated that they would meet in the
same place next Sabbath, the first Sabbath of June, the
anniversary of the battle of Drumclog; and he waxed
eloquent as he held up John Brown of Priesthill’s
Bible, and referred to the other relics before him, until
the audience felt the martyr spirit, and were sorry
that he concluded so soon.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the singing of the day,
and will only add that the singing of the concluding
psalm—cxxii., verses 6–9, to the tune of “St.
Paul’s”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pray that Jerusalem may have</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Have still prosperity”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>was grand. The evening’s collection made the day’s
offering amount altogether to over £38. I have
dwelt at more length than I intended on this subject,
but it was a great event for a little place. Very
possibly I have overdrawn the picture; but had you
mingled with the companies of the worshippers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
they walked homewards, you would have heard Mr.
Barrie’s oldest hearers say he never preached like that
in his life before, and strangers that they had no idea
that Mr. Barrie could preach like that,—“he was a man
of immense ability,—the best sermon they had ever
heard,—it’s a wonder he had been so long in Blinkbonny.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRIENDS IN DEED.</i></div>

<p>The attendance at the Annie Green on the first
Sabbath of June was as large as on the previous
Sabbath, and the services had special reference to the
struggles of the Covenanters and the battle of Drumclog.
Old George Brown was highly satisfied. “I
have often,” said he, “spoken to Mr. Barrie about
saying ower little about thae Cath’lics, and that he
should raise his testimony against Prelacy and Popery;
but he aye said that even if he was speakin’ to
Cath’lics, he wad preach the plain gospel, an’ no scare
them away by denouncin’ baith them an’ their system,
or settin’ them against the truth by no’ speakin’ it in
love; and for his ain people, it would ‘minister questions
rather than godly edifying,’ as he thocht that
runnin’ doon the Cath’lics was apt to make folk think
because they werena Cath’lics that they were a’ richt,
an’ beget spiritual pride. An’ he wasna far wrang.
But his subject led him <i>on</i> the day, and I was
uncommon pleased to hear him speak as he did o’ the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
auld worthies, Knox and Melville, and Cameron an’
Peden, and my forbear Brown, an’ let this backslidin’,
worldly-minded generation ken hoo far behint their
ancestors they were in courage an’ piety, in thocht,
word, an’ deed.”</p>

<p>There was a congregation of the United Secession,
now the United Presbyterian, Church in Blinkbonny,
and Mr. Morrison, the minister, and his session had
generously offered to accommodate the Free Church,
as far as lay in their power, with the use of their
church, as the largest hall in the village was too small
for the congregation. Mr. Morrison was a diligent
student, conscientious and minute in his preparations
for the pulpit: he wrote these carefully out, and
spent the last two days of the week in committing
them to memory. He was an estimable man, an
excellent scholar, had been a great reader, and was
well versed in general science; but he had an affluence
of words and a Johnsonian style of composition that
injured him as a preacher. His matter was good,
sound, unexceptionable, but his manner of conveying
it was verbose, often a mere recasting of the grand
old English of the Bible into a laboured and profuse
style of expression. He seldom used the terse old
Saxon words if he could get a word of grander sound
derived from another language, but used “plenitude”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
instead of “fulness,” “capacitate” for “fit,” and “salubrious”
for “healthy.” His voice was good, but the
long, involved sentences made it appear monotonous,
and justified the critique of old Robert Gunn: “Vera
gude matter, nae doubt, but tedious, a wee tedious.
He has lang ‘heids,’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> an’ disna aye gi’e them ower
again in the same words, which fickles<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the young
folk that have to tell the ‘heids an’ particulars’ when
they gang hame; for if, as is gey an’ often the case,
the first ‘heid’ is, ‘The persons mentioned in the text,’
we’re almost sure to hear when he’s done with it,
‘Having thus considered, in the first place, the individuals
to whom reference is made in the deeply
interesting and highly instructive passage which I
have selected as the subject of this morning’s exposition,’
which is baith confusin’ an’ tedious.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORN AND CHAFF.</i></div>

<p>The services in the “Meetin’-house,” the local
name of the Secession Church, occupied without interval
fully three hours, and included a lecture and a
sermon of at least an hour each. In order to suit
the Free Church, these were begun at ten o’clock,
and ours at one. This put Mr. Morrison to the
serious difficulty of condensing his services. For the
first two Sabbaths he did not manage this. As he
had <i>proposed</i> that the Free Church should meet at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>one o’clock, he was remonstrated with very plainly by
some of his people. Robert Gunn, a forward “body,”
had suggested the means: “Just dicht [sift] yer corn
better, and leave less chaff in’t.”</p>

<p>On the third Sabbath he got through in about
two hours and a half, and kept thereafter rather
within that limit, although not without having often
to say, “Did time permit, I would have proceeded,”
etc., or, “The brief space of time at my disposal
prevents me from entering on the full illustration of
my next head, but I may say in a word—.” That was
an ominous expression, and the result often proved it
an inconsistent one, as the “word,” or “one word
more,” seldom occupied less than fifteen minutes.
“Lastly, and very briefly,” was another term contradicted
by the sequel.</p>

<p>The shorter service was a comfortable change for
those whose uneasy task it was to keep their children
“behaving themselves” in the church. James Spence,
whose regular remark to his neighbours on their road
home had been, “He said a great deal, really he said
a very great deal,” gave as his opinion that “he
really thocht that there was less skailt noo that the
kirk skailed sooner,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for even yet there was a great
deal said that we couldna carry home, and mair that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>we didna carry oot; and wi’ the bairns no’ bein’ sae
fashious through no’ bein’ sae lang in, we could attend
better.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> “There was less spilt now that the church was dismissed sooner.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Free Church services in the Meeting-house
were well attended. Many of the Seceders joined in
them, and confessed with shame that their sectarian
bitterness towards the principle of a church establishment
had extended to its ministers, on whom they
had looked uncharitably as “Samaritans,” with whom
they could have no dealings, and they were surprised
to find Mr. Barrie so excellent. Maggie Gunn told
her father “that yon minister preached as well as
Mr. Morrison, only far better.” Mr. Barrie became a
favourite with them; although, to the honour of all
parties be it told, that no one left the Secession to
join the Free Church on that account. Between Mr.
Morrison and himself, as well as between the office-bearers
and congregations, there existed the most
cordial relationships, and the interchange of pleasant
communion and fellowship. I look back with so
much delight to the sympathy and help we got in
the beginning of our way from our Secession friends,
that I fear I have been, to use Robert Gunn’s phrase,
“a wee tedious.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW PARISH MINISTER.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Walker of Middlemoor was Mr. Barrie’s successor
in the parish church of Blinkbonny. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
making application to Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland for the
living, he was very honest in telling his motives,
viz. that the stipend was larger, and the manse and
glebe were better; and his family were growing up,
and he would like to get settled in a place where
he could get openings for the older ones, schooling
for the younger ones, and where they could all come
home at night; and he would be very much obliged
to Sir John if he would present him to Blinkbonny.
And he was presented and inducted in due form
and time.</p>

<p>He was a kind-hearted, stout, canny man, of moderate
abilities as a scholar and preacher. His parish
of Middlemoor was a small one, in a pastoral and
moorland district, thinly peopled. It had a large
glebe of indifferent land, which he cultivated diligently
to eke out his small stipend. He was quite as good
at farming as preaching, and had, on Mr. Barrie’s
suggestion, been Bell’s adviser in the purchase or sale
of cows, sheep, or pigs. Even on the subject of
poultry he was at home, as he made his son keep a
“hen journal,” partly as a lesson in book-keeping, and
partly as a practical application of the inspired proverb,
which was often in his mouth, “Be diligent to know
the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.”</p>

<p>He was a frequent visitor at Mr. Barrie’s, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
occasional “assistant” at the October communion
services, and a regular member of the “thanksgiving”
dinner-party at the manse on the Monday thereafter.
He was a man of peace, and took little interest in the
Voluntary, Disruption, or other controversies; and when
these formed the subject of after-dinner discussion, he
left the dining-room, and slowly betook himself to
the kitchen for a smoke, for he was an inveterate
smoker.</p>

<p>He looked relieved as he entered the kitchen; said,
“Well, Bell;” dropt heavily into the arm-chair which
stood at the fireside (the arms of which were barely
wide enough to admit him, but they yielded with a
creak, and he got in, but had to press them firmly
down before he got out); took out his pipe—generally
a short black one; knocked out the dottle<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on the
hob-plate; tried if it would draw, and if not, cleared
the bowl with the point of his knife, and if that
failed, asked Bell for a stalk of lavender. When the
pipe was cleared to his mind, he slowly cut some thin
slices from a roll of twist tobacco, rubbed the fragments
between his hands, filled his pipe, put on the “dottle,”
and applied the “spunk,” from which Bell had broken
off the sulphur tip. All these operations and details
were done with very great deliberation and in grave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>silence, with the exception of asking the lavender
stalk, which was only resorted to after the knife and
the repeated blowings from the bowl and shank ends
of the pipe had failed; and after it was fairly lighted
and going well, he began an intermittent, congenial
crack.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THUS THINK AND SMOKE TOBACCO.</i>”</div>

<p>Tobacco smoke Bell could not endure. No other
person would have been permitted to pollute her
kitchen with it, and as a general rule she got Mr.
Walker to combine his inspection of the garden and
glebe with “enjoyin’ his smoke;” but as this dinner-day
came round she had to submit, so she provided
against it by removing the hams and things of that
sort, that they might not be “scomfished;” and she
set herself to enjoy the leisurely preparations, and to
respect the silence with which they were conducted,
as the after-crack was sure to be quite to her mind.</p>

<p>At the last October dinner, after a few soothing
whiffs, Mr. Walker began the colloquy with, “Bell,
I’m glad to get away from these discussions about
the Kirk; I cannot bear them. I like better to
talk about live stock. How are yours?”</p>

<p>Bell entered heartily into an account of her year’s
doings, and Mr. Walker listened approvingly, and in
return told about his crops and herds, and what the
“mairt” (the animal which had been killed and salted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
for winter use) had weighed, and how the hens, bees,
etc. had done—alternately speaking and smoking. I
cannot give the interview in detail, but both agreed
they had had a grand crack—better than ony kirk
quarrels.</p>

<p>It was from the following story, which Mr. Walker
then told, that Bell had first heard of the Church
“question;” but his way of putting it was so conclusive
to Bell, that she thought no more about it
until the matter of the potatoes brought it home to
herself.</p>

<p>A lady from Leith had come to reside in Middlemoor,
and had said to the farmer of Hillend, who had
accosted her with, “Weel, mem, hoo d’ye like to bide
in this moorland country?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed, it’s delightful! If I had only
my own doctor and my own minister, I would stay
here all the year through; but you know your country
doctors are not quite—quite—well—well enough in
their way, but not <i>quite</i> like the town doctors; and
the ministers are <i>very</i> nice—” This she said in a hesitating
undertone, not expressive of hearty concurrence,
and ended in a firmer voice, “but not like my own.”</p>

<p>“’Deed, mem,” said Hillend, “gi’e us farmers a gude
miller an’ a gude smith, an’ we can do weel enough wi’
ony ministers or doctors that likes to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>

<p>“That wasna bad for Hillend,” said Bell.</p>

<p>“Well, Bell,” said Mr. Walker, “I thought it rather
hard on the ministers when I first heard the story,
but—” And here he gave his views of the Non-Intrusionists
with, for him, unusual fervour, and added,
“<i>Now</i> I quite agree with Hillend, that congregations
should accept, and welcome, and honour the ministers
who are appointed over them.”</p>

<p>“That’s without a doubt,” said Bell; “and esteem
them very highly for their work’s sake.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>AS YOU LIKE IT.</i>”</div>

<p>The news of Mr. Walker’s appointment to Blinkbonny
was received with first a stare, then a shrug of
the shoulders, then a pretty general feeling that “they
might have had worse.” He was certainly not a
shining light, but he was a nice man, had a large
family, and it would be a good change for them. And
although the local poetaster circulated a sorry effusion
on the subject, in which he, without acknowledgment,
stole from Cowper’s <i>Needless Alarm</i>,—</p>

<p>changing the original “Cambrian” to “Moorland,”
it did not take, and Blinkbonny on its personal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
social and “soft” side was ready to “entertain”
Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>He carried the news of his own appointment to the
manse, and although it surprised Mr. Barrie at the
moment, he heartily wished him every success and
comfort, and added that he would find the manse at
his service by the time he was inducted. Mr. Walker
assured Mr. Barrie that there was no hurry, as “he
did not see that they could possibly come in until
after the harvest was past at Middlemoor.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JEWS AND BRITHERS.</i></div>

<p>When Bell heard that Mr. Walker was coming to
Blinkbonny, she forgot her usual good manners. “Mr.
Walker!—Walker o’ Middlemoor!—fat Walker’s
gotten the kirk, has he? He’s a slow coach—pity
the folk that gangs to hear him; but ’deed they’ll no’
mony gang. He minds me o’ Cauldwell’s speech at
the cattle show. After Sir John palavered away
about the grand stock, and praised Cauldwell for
gettin’ sae money prizes, the decent man just said,
‘Sir John and gentlemen, thank ye a’ kindly. I’m
nae hand o’ makin’ a speech. I may be a man
among sheep, but I’m a sheep among men.’” And
Bell showed how changeable human affections are;
for although Mr. Walker and she had been hand-and-glove
friends, she summed up with, “Mr. Walker will
never fill Mr. Barrie’s shoon [shoes]. I never could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
thole<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> him an’ his filthy tobacco smoke. Ugh! ma
puir kitchen will sune be in a bonny mess; an’ I
dinna ken what to think about the things in the
garden an’ outhouses that are <i>ours</i>, for, as Mrs. Walker
ance said to me, her motto was, ‘Count like Jews and
’gree like brithers.’”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Endure.</p>

</div>

<p>But when the settling up came, Bell found Mrs.
Walker “easy dealt wi’,”—not only satisfied with her
valuation, but very complimentary as to the state in
which everything was left, and very agreeable—very.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. BARRIE had written to Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland,
thanking him for his uniform kindness, and
saying that he had disjoined himself from the
Established Church. He also wrote to the clerk
of his presbytery to the same effect, adding that he
would leave the manse as soon as he could.</p>

<p>A short time sufficed to put Knowe Park into
habitable order. Whenever this was known, Mr.
Barrie was cumbered by proffers of help from the
farmers in the parish. He could have had fifty
carts to remove his furniture for one that he
required; and acts or offers of considerate attention
were so showered on him that he was embarrassed
by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>At length the day came for “flitting.” It was a fine
morning in the middle of summer,—everything was
looking its best. The manse in itself was a charming
place. To Mr. and Mrs. Barrie and their children
it had been a happy home, and in their inmost hearts
it was hallowed by many tender associations; and the
church was endeared to Mr. Barrie as he recalled the
pleasant meetings therein with his beloved flock.
The parting was a bitter ordeal, trying to flesh and
blood, and as such they felt it very keenly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MELODY OF JOY AND PEACE.</i></div>

<p>At the hour for family worship, the men who were
taking down the furniture and making it ready for
being carted were asked to come to the “books;” and
they told afterwards that in singing the 23d Psalm
their voices quivered, and that there was a lump in
their throat as the 138th Psalm was read as the
“<i>ordinary</i>” for the morning, for the circumstances
seemed to give additional meaning to such parts of it
as—“strengthenedst me with strength in my soul,”
“though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive
me,” “the Lord will perfect that which concerneth
me,” “forsake not the works of Thine own hands.”</p>

<p>As soon as the first cart was laden and off, Bell
went to Knowe Park to get things put rightly in and
up. The three elder children had resolved to flit
their own belongings. James took his small barrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
filled with a confused load of skates, books, etc.
Mary carried her little chair, Black Tam the negro
doll, and some books and toys; Lewie his little chair,
a toy horse, and a whip. They had reached the
post office (which stood a little back from the main
street), and were resting on the broad open pavement
in front of it, James sitting on his barrow, the
others in their chairs.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>DR. GUTHRIE AND THE BAIRNS.</i></div>

<p>Dr. Guthrie, who had been spending a day or two
in the neighbourhood, was calling at the post office.
Soon, as his quick eye rested on the singular group,
his face became radiant with such a smile as <i>he</i> could
give, and which the children returned very frankly.
He went close to them, stooped down and patted
Mary’s cheek, got his hand under her chin and stroked
it playfully, all the while looking kindly in her face;
then glancing at her lap, he said:</p>

<p>“What’s the name of that fine doll, my wee pet? is
it Sambo, or Pompey, or what?”</p>

<p>“That’s black Tam,” said Mary. “It was Nellie’s
doll, and I’m taking it to our new house.”</p>

<p>“Nellie’s, was it? And is Nellie too old for dolls
now, and has she given it to you? He looks as if he
had seen better days.”</p>

<p>“Oh! please; sir, Nellie’s dead,” said Mary, looking
towards the churchyard; “she’s buried over there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p>“But Bell and mamma say that Nellie’s in heaven,”
said Lewie very decidedly.</p>

<p>The suddenness and beauty of Lewie’s answer strongly
affected Dr. Guthrie. He took out his snuff-box and took
a moderate pinch, then clapped Lewie’s head, and said:</p>

<p>“Yes, my wee man, you’re right; Nellie’s in heaven.
But what’s your name?”</p>

<p>James now took speech in hand: “My name’s
James Barrie, and this is Mary, and this is Lewie.
We’re flitting from the manse over yonder;” and he
pointed in the same direction as Mary had looked.
But Dr. Guthrie, thus suddenly brought into contact
with this stern reality of the Disruption, had again to
apply to his snuff-box, and was in the act of taking it
out of his pocket when Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland drove up
to the post office and alighted. Dr. Guthrie and he
knew one another as members of Assembly, and they
shook hands cordially, Sir John expressing surprise
at seeing the doctor there.</p>

<p>“Sir John,” said the doctor, “excuse me,”—and he
dried the tear that was coursing down his cheek,—“do
you know these children?”</p>

<p>Sir John had not observed the group, but he looked
at them long enough to admit of Dr. Guthrie pulling
out his box, taking one good snuff, and getting another
ready for despatch in his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Sir John, “they are Mr. Barrie’s
children;” then looking at James: “How are mamma
and papa keeping?”</p>

<p>The children had risen, and the boys had taken
off their caps when Sir John appeared. In answer
to the question James said: “They’re quite well,
thank you, sir; we’re all going to our new house
to-day; <i>we’re</i> helping to flit.”</p>

<p>Dr. Guthrie took his reserve snuff, looked first at
Sir John, then at the children, and swinging his hand
so that it pointed to the children, then to the manse,
and resting it now towards them and again towards
it, he recited with much feeling, for he seemed deeply
moved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From scenes like these old Scotia’s grandeur springs,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">An honest man’s the noblest work of God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="leftnote"><i>GIFF-GAFF.</i></div>

<p>By this time several of the villagers were attracted
by the scene, and they scarcely could repress the
cheer that was struggling for vent in their throats.
Respect for Sir John, however, kept it down until he
drove away, when a right hearty greeting was given
to Dr. Guthrie, in whose eyes the tear still trembled,
and many pressed forward to grasp his hand,—none
more warmly than Kennedy the tailor, who, producing
his snuff-box, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p>“Ye’ll excuse me, sir; I dinna ken ye, but—ye’ll
excuse me, sir—but would ye do me the honour of
takin’ a snuff out of my box?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my good friend,” said the doctor; “and
we’ll giff-gaff,” handing his box to the tailor, and
helping himself out of Kennedy’s dimpled, black-looking,
oval-shaped tin box.</p>

<p>The tailor took a pinch, said it was “prime snuff,”
and added: “Burns is a great poet, and that was a
grand verse you gied us the noo, and the occasion’s
worthy o’t. Mr. Barrie ’s an honest man, but he’s far
mair, he’s a patriot-martyr.”</p>

<p>The last cartload had left the manse; there was
nothing for Mr. and Mrs. Barrie to do but lock
the door and follow. They paid a farewell visit to
each room. Their footsteps sounded harshly through
the house, now empty and dreary, still they were
loath to leave. When they were fairly outside of the
front door they lingered on its step; then Mr. Barrie,
with a quick “This will never do,” locked the door
and withdrew the key.</p>

<p>They were bracing themselves for their trying walk
past the church, past the churchyard, and through
the village, when a noise, a familiar noise, yet with
an eerie wail in it, made them both start. It came
from old Tibby the cat—Nellie’s Tibby. Bell had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
carried her to Knowe Park in a basket as carefully
as if she had been Nellie herself, and had shut her
up in a room. When the children came, James
and Mary had got strict orders to watch her; but
Tibby had beaten them all and got off, and home and
into some quiet corner of the manse, whence, when
the door was locked, she crept out, uttering her wailing
protest.</p>

<p>“Poor Tibby,” said Mrs. Barrie, “we must take you
with us.”</p>

<p>When the door was re-opened, Tibby was easily
caught. She had evidently felt convinced, after a
bewildered ramble through the empty house, that
there was some reason for her late transportation and
imprisonment.</p>

<p>This little incident re-opened the floodgates of
tender memories, and forced tears from Mrs. Barrie’s
eyes, although by that time the fountain had been
largely drawn upon. She felt thankful to have something
else than herself to think of; and Tibby’s
presence in her arm, tucked cosily into the corner of
her shawl, served to divide her attention, and supplied
sufficient amount of occupation to make the walk less
trying to her. She leaned heavily on Mr. Barrie’s
arm, partly from weariness, partly from excitement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW HOME.</i></div>

<p>When they reached Knowe Park, Bell had tea set for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
them in the parlour; and the children, having already
made a complete round of the whole premises, gave at
the tea-table cheering proofs that they had not lost
their appetites, as well as curious details of what they
had discovered in their ramblings over their new home.</p>

<p>Bell had got the bedrooms into wonderful order for
their accommodation at night, and this deprived kind
neighbours of the pleasure they would have had in
“putting up” for a few nights all or any of the
family. Within a few days they all felt quite at
home, and the additional work entailed by making
the manse things go as far as they could, kept them
so busy that they were surprised at their having got
over the flitting, and especially the “<i>leaving</i>” of the
manse, so soon and so quietly.</p>

<p>I did not think it possible that Bell could have
wrought harder than I had always known her to do;
but she did, and soon Knowe Park was as much to
her, in as far as the garden and live stock were concerned,
as the old homestead had been. And although
Guy the beadle offered to bring out of the manse
garden whatever she wished, Bell had enough and to
spare, and told Guy to use for himself what he liked,
and after that only to sell what was ripe or “near
spoiling.”</p>

<p>True to his trust, Guy brought her a fair sum of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
money obtained in this way, which she handed to
Mr. Barrie, not Mrs. Barrie as usual, telling him how it
had come. Mr. Barrie was greatly pleased with Guy
and Bell, and thanked them warmly; but to Bell’s
astonishment he handed her back the money, and
said: “Give it to the poor, Bell, and oh! let us be
thankful we have something to give away.”</p>

<p>This was several steps in advance of Bell’s notions
of what was called for, and she spoke to Mrs. Barrie
about it. Mrs. Barrie was well aware that she would
need to be very economical, but Mr. Barrie’s “thankful
to have something to give away” was so like
himself, and the money had come so unexpectedly,
that she said:</p>

<p>“Certainly, Bell, we’ll carry out Mr. Barrie’s wishes;
and when something has thus come that we <i>can</i> give,
let us be thankful to get the more blessedness, for it
<i>is</i> more blessed to give than to receive.”</p>

<p>Bell could not quite go in with this doctrine. She
thought for a little, and then said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“Just so, mem; but you’ll surely no’ object to me

<p>“Do as you have always done, Bell; no directions
I could give would serve you so well as your own
good sense. And I have been so unsettled by the
events of the past two months that I hardly know my
own mind; but one thing I do know, and feel—”
here Mrs. Barrie’s eyes filled, and she finished the
sentence with a trembling voice, “and that is, that
you have been a sister and a mother to us all,—a
Deborah and a Ruth, a Martha and a Dorcas put
together. May God reward you.”</p>

<p>This was nearly too much for Bell, but the necessity
of getting on and getting through was pressing her
strongly. She accordingly braced herself up, and said
in a cheerful tone:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barrie, I’ve gotten ower a’ my fears an’ cares
o’ a worldly kind about this kirk business, an’ I’m
humbled to think that I spoke to you an’ the minister
an’ ithers as I did, an’ that I didna join the noble
army till after the battle was won; but noo,” said she
with great solemnity, “I pray that I may mak’ up for
my faintin’ in the day o’ adversity by settin’ my face
like a flint to my wark,” and here she lowered her
tone. “But I’m forgettin’ mysel’, an’ we maun a’ set
the stout heart to the stey [steep] brae, an’ gather up
the loins o’ our minds and heads and hands, and no’
turn back like Lot’s wife. We’re gaun to dae fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
here: the range is very licht on the coals; an’ the
hens are takin’ to the place, an’ layin’ weel; an’
Daisy’s up to her knees in clover,” and here Bell
put on her blithest look, “an’ I never saw either
Mr. Barrie or you lookin’ better. And we maunna let
it be said that we’re ‘unsettled,’ when in every sense
o’ the word we’re settled, and weel settled,—we
couldna be better,—we’re just real weel set.”</p>

<p>Bell’s hearty speech put Mrs. Barrie into good
spirits. She left the kitchen with a smile on her
lip and a warm thought in her heart, which found
expression as she walked through the lobby in “Thank
God for Bell!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SCIENCE AND POULTRY.</i></div>

<p>Bell was contentedly happy because she was constantly
busy, and her schemes prospered. From the
day Mr. Barrie had hinted at the possibility of their
leaving the manse, she set herself to contrive if by
any means she could be more than ever one of the
bread-winners, and her first attempt was on the hens.
Some one had told her about the increased yield of
eggs which Sir John’s henwife had got by some
changes she had made in the food and treatment of
her poultry. Bell adopted the new system, and improved
on it. She succeeded far beyond her expectations,
and with a happy face told me of her luck one
afternoon when she was ordering some peppercorns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and other spices, with which to experiment still further
on a notion of her own.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying different plans wi’ my hens. I
first gied them dry grain, and they did but middlin’;
then I gied them rough meal, an’ they did better;
syne I boiled their meat, an’ put a ‘curn’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> o’ spice
in’t, an’ they did splendid—far mair than paid for the
extra meat; then I got a cracknel frae the candlemaker
(ane o’ yon dark, cheese-lookin’ things that
they make out o’ the rinds o’ fat, an’ skins, an’ sic
like that comes out o’ their tallow), and boiled a bit o’
it among their meat, and the result was extraordinary;
they just laid on an’ on till they actually reduced
themselves to fair skeletons. I was fair affronted to
see them about the place, an’ I had to gi’e them a rest
an’ change their victuals. <i>Now</i> I try to mix their
meat so as to get them baith to lay weel an’ to be size
for the table. But ye’ll hae seen what grand eggs I’ve
been sending to yoursel’, an’ how mony mair than
before?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> A small quantity.</p>

</div>

<p>I knew that to be the case, and said so. Bell continued:</p>

<p>“But besides that, early in the spring I got some
settings o’ eggs that they say are a grand kind, and
the birds are a gude size a’ready. I got them from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Dan Corbet, an’ so I wadna like to say very muckle
about them, for Dan’s no’ aye to lippen<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to. ’Deed,
since we’ve come to live nearer him, I’m no sae high
about them, for he has a vermin o’ game-cocks about
him, and they whiles cross the north park and fecht
wi’ mine—they’re a fair torment.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Trust.</p>

</div>

<p>Dan Corbet was a “queer mixture.” He was a
native of Blinkbonny, but had been out of the parish
for several years; report said he had been a smuggler
on the west coast of Scotland. He returned to his
native parish about the year 1820, with scars on his
face, and without one of his eyes, which gave him a
sinister look. For some years he had been night-watchman
in the churchyard, as the outrageous custom
of violating the sanctity of the grave in order to procure
subjects for surgical demonstration and actual use
in teaching anatomy had sent a thrill of horror over
Scotland, and had led to the systematic watching of
churchyards by at least two individuals every night.
Dan was the paid regular watchman, and at least one
or more respectable householders by turns watched
with him. Dan’s reckless character fitted him for the
dreary post; and although none of those who watched
with him respected him, they found that he was always
wakeful, and, in the matter in hand, trustworthy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUMMIE DOCTOR.</i></div>

<p>When the night watching was given up, Dan maintained
himself by doing on a larger scale the odd sorts
of jobs which he had sometimes taken in hand in order
to add to his salary as watchman, or “dummie doctor,”
as he was called. My older readers will remember
with what feelings of indignation the resurrectionists
or dummie doctors (for these were the names given to
the violators of the graves) were spoken of, and that
after their disappearance the odious name, “dummie
doctor,” sometimes stuck to the watchman.</p>

<p>Dan acted amongst the surrounding farmers as
butcher, mole-catcher, rat-catcher, and, in a rough
way, as a veterinary surgeon; was employed as extra
hand at sheep-shearings, corn-threshings, etc. He was
a regular attender of local cattle markets, fairs, races,
and games; a good and keen fisher, and strongly suspected
of being a poacher, but never convicted. He
was a wiry, spare, athletic man of about 5 feet 11
inches high, with a weatherbeaten countenance, thin
grizzled hair, and a long stride. He lived in a cottage,
divided by a single park-breadth from Knowe Park,
and kept a perfect menagerie of dogs, ferrets, goats, and
fowls—the latter being principally game sorts. His
favourite pastime was cock-fighting; but it was, to
Dan’s great regret, being discountenanced and put
down. He had a variety of surnames; “the Corbie,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
as a contraction of his own name, was the most common,
but he was known as the “Mowdie” (mole), the “Rat,”
the “Doctor,” the “Vet.,” and “Ggemmie,” as well as
the “Dummie Doctor” or “Dummie.”</p>

<p>The eggs he had given to Bell were not from his
stock, but had been got in exchange for some of these;
and as he had sometimes been employed by Bell as a
butcher, there was a trade connection between them,
but the intimacy had been purely “professional,” as
Dan, in the matter of social position or religion, was
looked on as quite an outcast; and the description of
him, in this respect, ranged from “a poor creature” to
“an awfu’ man.”</p>

<p>Dan had got a setting of eggs from a very rare strain
of game fowls, and had been loud in laying off their
properties to his cronies, some of whom, on the night
that Dan “set” them, took them carefully from under
the hen and put ducks’ eggs in their place; they then
crossed the field, got over Knowe Park wall, and put
Dan’s eggs under one of Bell’s “clockers,”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> using every
precaution not to injure the eggs, as well as to avoid
detection.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Clucking hens.</p>

</div>

<p>Dan waited long and wearily for his expected brood;
he looked for them on the reckoned day, but it passed,
and the next, and the next, until a full week had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>elapsed, and still no birds. Early on the eighth
morning he determined to “pitch” the eggs away, and
was angrily stooping down to lift off the hen, which,
although it was a great favourite and a “splendid
sitter,” would have had a rough toss and a long one,
when he heard a cheep.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIDDEN TREASURES.</i></div>

<p>The welcome sound was marrow to his bones. “Eh!”
was his first exclamation; “what’s that? is’t possible
after a’?” He heard more cheeping. “Isn’t it a gude
thing I’ve been sae patient?” Then looking at the hen,
which, but a minute before, he was preparing to use
very roughly, he said, “Eh, grannie, grannie, ye’re the
best clocker in the county; eh, my auld darlin’,
my queen o’ beauty, ye’ll no’ want your handfu’ o’
groats for this—I’ll gi’e ye a peck; jist anither day,
grannie, an’ ye’ll get oot wi’ yer darlin’s, ye ace o’
diements!”</p>

<p>The cheeping had now become very decided, and
Dan, again addressing grannie, said: “Sit on, my flower
o’ the flock, my fail-me-never, hap<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the giant-killers
wi’ yer bonnie, golden, cosy feathers just till the nicht,
till their wee jackets an’ glancin’ spurs are dry; an’
I’ll bring a’ the neebors about seven o’clock when they
come hame, and I’ll open the door, an’ ye’ll march out
like Wallington at the head o’ the Scotch Greys at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Waterloo; and will they no’ stare when they see
your sturdy family following ye like the Royal
Artillery?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Cover carefully.</p>

</div>

<p>He then locked the door, and “warned” his cronies
and neighbours to come “sharp seven,” and they would
see something really worth their while.</p>

<p>Dan was in the fidgets all afternoon. Shortly before
seven o’clock a small crowd had gathered in his garden,
to which Dan told the pedigree of the birds, and spoke
of their qualities in the most glowing terms.</p>

<p>“Let’s see them, Dan,” said several voices; “let’s
see them.”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for Watty,” said Dan; and turning to
a boy, said, “Gang to the house-end, ma man, an’ see if
he’s no’ comin’;” then addressing his visitors, he said,
“Watty’s the only man that I’m feared for in this district;
his birds hae beaten mine owre often; I’ll tether
him noo, or I’m cheated.”</p>

<p>As Dan finished this speech, Watty, a queer-looking
customer wearing a hairy skull-cap, smoking a short
black pipe, and with both hands in his pockets, joined
the gathering. He gave a side nod to Dan, and said
“Hoo’s a’?” to the company.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>’TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP.</i></div>

<p>“Noo for the show!” said Dan, as he unlocked the
hen-house (it was coal-house, goat-house, and served
various other purposes), and flung the door wide open,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
saying, “Come awa’, grannie, wi’ your ‘royal family.’
There’s a pictur’, men, for ye.”</p>

<p>Grannie’s family had been restless, because hungry
and particularly thirsty, and she and they obeyed
Dan’s summons with great readiness and even haste.</p>

<p>Watty, who had till then smoked on in silence,
quickly took the pipe out of his mouth, stooped a
little, shaded his eyes with one hand, and seemed
sadly puzzled. His first remark was:</p>

<p>“Man, Dan, they’ve awfu’ braid nebs” (broad bills).</p>

<p>“Braid nebs, or no’ braid nebs,” said Dan, “the
game’s there onyway.”</p>

<p>“May be,” said Watty, “but they have maist awfu’
braid nebs,” for by this time he and all the onlookers
had “smelt a rat;” “and in ma opinion they’re jucks.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re a juck!” said Dan, looking at him fiercely.</p>

<p>“Dinna look at me, Dan, look at <i>them</i>; look at their
nebs, look at their wab-feet—is thae no jucks?”</p>

<p>A second glance revealed to Dan that this was too true.</p>

<p>Roars of laughter, which only such an audience can
give, ensued, in which “Braid nebs,” “Gemm jucks,”
“Grannie’s royal family,” “Tether Watty,” were heard
amidst the noisy peals of the uncontrolled and apparently
uncontrollable merriment.</p>

<p>Dan looked unutterable things; his face was one of
dismal agony. He took side glances at the crowd;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
each followed by a long look—a perplexed, vindictive
look—at the ducklings; whilst all the while the crowd
waxed merrier, and laughed louder as they saw his
miserable, heartbroken countenance.</p>

<p>Watty stooped down to lift a duckling, saying at
the same time, “Man, Dan, have ye lost your sicht?
Div ye no’ see that thae’s jucks? Look at their nebs,
their feet, their size; hear their weet-weet;” but
“Grannie” barred the pass, flew at his hand, and pecked
it sharply. This revived the sorely afflicted Dan, and
rousing himself, he said, “Weel dune, grannie!” which
the crowd received with a cheer and a very loud laugh.</p>

<p>One of the onlookers, wishing to soothe Dan, said:
“Jucks are as gude as hens ony day, Dan; an’ they’re
healthy-like birds.”</p>

<p>“You ignorant gomeral!<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> you senseless blockhead!
you born idiot!” said Dan, his excitement increasing as
he proceeded; “jucks like game-cocks! jucks like the
kind o’ game-cocks that should ha’ been there, that
were set by my ain hands! haud yer bletherin’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
tongue. Somebody’s been puggyin’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> me. If I kent
wha dared to tak’ their nap<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> aff me, I wad gi’e them
what they wad mind a’ their days; I would <i>fell</i> them!”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Stupid fellow.</p>

</div>

<p>A large crowd had now collected in Dan’s garden,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>and when the new-comers heard the cause of the
merriment, they joined in it and kept it up.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE.</i></div>

<p>“What are ye a’ doin’ laughin’ there at, like
heeawnies [hyenas]? Out o’ this, every one o’ ye,
or I’ll gar some o’ ye laugh on the ither side o’ yer
lug [ear]!” said Dan, looking daggers.</p>

<p>“Lock them up, Dan, for fear the witches change
them into turkeys,” said one of the crowd.</p>

<p>This made Dan furious: he seized an old spade
which lay on the top of his hen-house, and vowed
that he “would <i>fell</i> ony man that said another word.”</p>

<p>“If ye can catch him,” said a waif, with a knowing
wink; and he made off as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“If I can what?” said Dan. “I believe you’re the
vagabond that’s puggied me, and I’ll catch ye, supple
an’ a’ as ye think ye are!”</p>

<p>Dan started, holding the spade over his head, fury
in his eye, vengeance in his heart. The crowd saw
that his blood was up, and cried, “Run, run, run for
your very life!”</p>

<p>The man got into the field that lay between Dan’s
cottage and Knowe Park; Dan followed, as did also
many of the crowd. The pursued man, repenting of his
rashness, and fearing the worst, as well he might,
made straight for Knowe Park wall.</p>

<p>Bell had heard the laughter when milking Daisy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Mr. and Mrs. Barrie had heard it when taking an
evening stroll in the garden, and all three were
standing at the wall wondering what could cause it,
as the laughter was unusually boisterous. They saw
the chase begin. The flying man observed Mr. Barrie,
and made toward him as to a city of refuge. When
Mr. Barrie saw Dan rushing on, so dangerously armed
and so furious, he cried loudly, “Stop, Corbett! stop!
I command you.”</p>

<p>This made Dan slacken his pace and lower his
spade, but he walked sulkily on with the crowd,
saying, “I’m no’ dune wi’ him yet. I’ll gi’e him’t for
this yet.—Wait a wee, just wait a wee,” until they
came to the wall of the garden.</p>

<p>“Whatever is all this about?” said Mr. Barrie.
“What’s wrong, Corbett, that you are so furious?”</p>

<p>“A’s wrang, sir, a’s wrang. I’ve been rubbit [<i>i.e.</i>
robbed], an’ insulted, an’ chagareened by that—” It took
Dan a little time to select an epithet strong enough for
the occasion, and at the same time fit for the minister’s
ears. This was a difficult matter; many rushed to his
tongue-end, strong, withering, seasoned; undoubtedly,
had it not been for Mr. Barrie, he would have fired
them off in a volley, and greatly relieved himself
thereby. At length he hurled out, “that unhanged
vagabond, he’s puggied me, but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Barrie looked at Dan, and said, “Stop, Corbett,
say no more till your passion cools;” then turning to
the crowd he said, “What is the cause of this unseemly
uproar?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROBING THE WOUND.</i></div>

<p>Watty and several others began to explain the
affair, but every one that attempted it had to stop
after saying a word or two; even the offending man,
although now quite safe, was unable to get beyond
“Dan set hens’ eggs” for laughing, and every man in
the field was writhing in fits and contortions, through
excessive laughter, with the exception of Dan, on
whom the laughter was telling like oil on a flame.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie looked at Dan, and seeing that he was
becoming even more ferocious, said calmly: “Corbett,
from the behaviour of the crowd I suspect they have
been playing some trick on you, and they evidently
have succeeded to their entire satisfaction, but to your
great annoyance. Please tell me really what has excited
you.”</p>

<p>Dan told his story. The laughter was quite as general,
but became more distant as he proceeded, for whilst
telling his tale he scowled on the “grinning baboons,”
as he called them, and clutched his spade angrily,
which still further widened the circle. Although Mr.
Barrie remained grave, Mrs. Barrie could not but
laugh quietly, and Bell, sheltered by an evergreen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
shrub, did so heartily, repeating, “Well, I never!” All
at once she stopped, thought a little, then saying to
herself, “That explains it,” she came close to the wall
at the point where Dan stood, and said: “There’s a
brood o’ chickens, lang-leggit, sharp-nebbit things,
come to me that I never set; they’re maybe yours,
they’re no ours—they’re come-o’-wills.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Dan; “whan did they come out?”</p>

<p>“This day week exactly.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see them. Come in, Watty, an’ gie’s your
skill o’ them,” said Dan, with a happier but still
nervous face; then addressing himself to Bell, he
said: “Hoo mony came oot?”</p>

<p>“Eleven out o’ thirteen; there were twa eggs did
naething.”</p>

<p>“That’s very gude; that’s grand!” said Dan, who
was already climbing the wall to get in.</p>

<p>“Had ye no’ better wait till the morn’s mornin’?”
said the considerate Bell. “They’re a’ shut up for
the nicht, an’ cosy under their mother’s wing; ye’ll
disturb them, puir things.”</p>

<p>“I maun see them the nicht; I’ll no’ live if I dinna
see them the noo, but I’ll be real canny wi’ them.
Come on.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BETTER LO’ED YE CANNA BE.</i></div>

<p>Dan, Watty, and Bell went to the “cavie” or hencoop,
folded back the old bag which had been dropt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
over the front of it to keep the inmates warm, and
Dan saw to his intense delight two little heads peeping
from under their feathery covering. His educated
although single eye at once settled the kind: “Game,
game, every inch o’ them, and baith cocks!” Then
turning to his crony he said: “Watty, you’ll lift the
hen canny, canny, an’ I’ll tak’ stock.”</p>

<p>The result was “six cocks an’ five hens, the real
true-blue breed,” declared by Dan, and confirmed by
Watty, with the addition of, “Dan, ye’re rich noo.”</p>

<p>Bell would not hear of them being shifted that
night, and ultimately persuaded Dan to “leave them
wi’ her hen till they were pickin’ for themselves; she
would take care o’ them, an’ nae cats could get near
them, for she had just gotten new nets.”</p>

<p>Dan got Bell to take the ducks,—“he couldn’t bear
them; there was nae water for them; his fowls wad
dab them till there was no’ ane left; it wad be a
great obleegement to him.”</p>

<p>When Dan got home he could not rest; he smartly
took down his fishing-rod and strode to the waterside.
The evening air cooled him, and he was further
consoled by a good take. Under the “bass” (straw
door-mat) at Knowe Park kitchen door next morning,
Bell found a ten-pound salmon and three good large
trouts—possibly they had not passed the water-bailiffs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Bell looked at all sides of the question of “what
to do with them?” Many difficulties presented themselves
to her honest, correct mind, and as the greatest
of these was, “What else could she do with them?”
she took in the foundlings and used them well.</p>

<p>There was a little coming and going between Bell
and Dan, until the chickens were able to shift for
themselves. When that was the case, he carried them
carefully over to his own house, and shared it with
them for a few months. The ducklings throve with
Bell, and she repaid Dan for them and the fish (for
she found out that her guess as to its having come
from Dan was correct) in several ways, but principally
by occasional dozens of her “buttered” eggs. When
eggs were abundant, and therefore cheap, she preserved
a large quantity by rubbing them when newly laid
with a very little butter all over, and keeping them in
salt. It was generally thought that she had some special
receipt or “secret,” for her buttered eggs had a fresh,
curdy, rich flavour that few preservers could attain to.</p>

<p>A penurious old maid had complained to Bell that
“she did not <i>understand</i> her hens; she was quite provoked
at them, because in the summer-time, when
eggs were only sixpence the dozen, they laid lots, but
in the winter-time, when they were more than double
that price, they would not lay at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span></p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>CATCHING A TARTAR.</i></div>

<p>Bell’s reply was: “I daresay no’; but ’deed, mem,
ye’ll need to baith feed them better, an’ keep them
cleaner and cosier, or they’ll do but little for you.”</p>

<p>The nicknames by which Dan had formerly been
distinguished were, after the affair of the ducklings,
dropt entirely out of use, and he was thereafter spoken
of as “Braidnebs,” although none could use it in his
hearing with impunity.</p>

<p>Thomas Scott, the farmer of Babbie’s Mill, a forward
ill-bred man, was speaking in the market to Mr.
Taylor, the elder already referred to in these “Bits.”
Dan chanced to pass near them, and the miller said,
loud enough for him and the most of the folks about
the cross to hear him, “Braidnebs or no’ braidnebs, the
game’s there onyway.”</p>

<p>Dan scowled at the miller, and tried to suppress
his rage. In his own words, “I tried to steek<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> my
mouth, but there was a rattlin’ in my throat like to
choke me. I lookit at Mr. Taylor. He kent,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> ’deed

bubblyjock<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> gangs about Babbie’s Mill yonder, but

<p>Poor “Babbie’s Mill” was well known to be “hen-pecked”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>at home, and the laugh was so cleverly, so
deservedly, so daringly turned against him, that he
was nonplussed for a little; but he screwed up his
courage, and tried to look disdainfully at Dan. Dan’s
single eye was glaring at him, and the blank socket
of his other eye was twitching nervously. The miller
looked bold, and said: “Go about your business, ye
ill-tongued scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“Ye what?” shrieked Dan, going close up to the
miller, who stept back and tried to move off; but Dan
followed him closely, and poured out, in a voice compounded
of bawling, howling, and hissing, whilst all
the while his arm moved quickly up and down:
“What did ye say?—ill-tongued? Wha has as ill a
tongue as yoursel’, if it be na your wife? Ye’ll daur
to insult a man in the middle o’ the street that wasna

<p>Thomas Scott, the miller of Babbie’s Mill, slunk off
a sulky, crestfallen man. From that day he was nicknamed
“the dabbit turkey,” and turkeys became known
in the district as “babbies,”—not a little to the confusion
of those who did not know the above incident,
for it was not uncommon to hear about “a slice of a
good fat babbie;” that Mrs. Graham had killed twenty
babbies and sent them in to Edinburgh for Christmas;
and, what was perhaps more puzzling still, that Mrs.
Clark “had gotten seven babbies killed by rats in one
night, but it didna pit her very sair about, for she had
as mony left as she cared for.”</p>

<p>I will have occasion to fill in some of the “lights”
of Dan’s character before I finish these “Bits;” meantime
I must leave him in shadow, and proceed in the

<p class="drop-cap">THE formation and early history of the Free
Church congregation of Blinkbonny is the
subject of the following chapter; and I feel it to be
one of special difficulty, not from any scarcity of
interesting matter, but from the fear that my treatment
of it may unhappily be misconstrued as an
indirect attempt to promote sectarian interests.</p>

<p>Nothing is farther from my intention than to make
the Established Church compare unfavourably with
the Free Church. My desire is to present to my
readers a sketch of some of the things that occurred,
and of some of the persons that were engaged about
them, in as far as my memory will enable me to
recall these, not as a partisan, but as an annalist. I
disclaim any such ambitious design as to attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
to embody in the “Bits” a description of what
might be taken as a fairly representative Free Church
minister and congregation of the Disruption times;
and when I have to refer to matters relating to the
churches as a whole, I will try to confine myself
to what will tend to account for or explain the
proceedings of the Free Church of Blinkbonny, without
stirring up old questions, or unduly favouring
any side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DETERMINED, DARED, AND DONE.</i></div>

<p>It is not too much to say that the Disruption of
1843 was a great event, especially so for Scotland.
The day on which it took place, the 18th of May
1843, is a day to be remembered, as during its course
a noble spectacle of adherence to principle at great
personal sacrifice was witnessed, of which any nation
might justly feel proud. Nor were there awanting
expressions of admiration; for even those who took
the opposite side, and considered the Disruption as
unnecessary and unwise, recognised it as a grand
exhibition of Christian courage.</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indentx">And even the ranks of Tuscany</div>
    <div class="verse indentx">Could scarce forbear to cheer.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hundreds of highly educated men,—men of large
experience and sound judgment, many of whom had
near and dear ones entirely dependent on them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
most of them with no means of providing for their
households or themselves excepting their incomes as
clergymen,—men of like passions and wants, and weaknesses
and necessities, as are common to all mankind,
left the Church of their fathers, the Church of their
life-work, the Church that they loved and had tried
to protect and beautify, because they considered <i>that</i>
to be their duty to their divine Master. The result
has happily shown that in Scotland, and in various
parts of the world, tens of thousands both of men
and women could not only applaud such heroism as
a grand sentiment, but that they could and did rally
round the heroes, espouse their cause, and provide
abundantly and with alacrity the means not only for
the supply of their temporal wants, but also for
pushing forward the cause they had at heart. Nor
was personal effort awanting; for the Disruption
leaders and ministers were themselves surprised as
well as delighted by the zeal, energy, and devotion
with which persons of all ranks became fellow-workers
with them in building up the Free Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>The present generation knows but little of the
occasional but determined opposition that many landowners
displayed, particularly in the refusal of sites
for Free churches, expecting and even resolving that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
they would thereby starve the people out, and bring
them back to the Established Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HIGH PLACES OF THE FIELD.</i></div>

<p>I cannot and should not do more than refer to
the great hardships and privations to which ministers
and congregations were exposed, not only by the
refusal of sites for churches, but by petty tyrannies
exercised on them and on those who befriended, even
on those who only pitied, these humble worshippers
among the fir woods of Strathspey, on the stormy headlands
of Mull or Skye, or on the bleak shores and
barren moors of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.</p>

<p>Even in the Lowlands, among the pastoral solitudes
of Canonbie, or the gusty winds of Wanlockhead, said
to be the highest inhabited place in Scotland, sites
were not only refused, but our common humanity was
outraged by wanton and sustained interference with
such little protection as a thin tent, an old barn,
or even an old quarry might afford; and this not
only in the year of the Disruption, but for years
thereafter, until it was made the subject of parliamentary
inquiry.</p>

<p>To those to whom these facts are new, I would
recommend the perusal of the <i>Annals of the Disruption</i>
Part III., recently issued by authority of the Free
Church of Scotland. Besides giving many interesting
facts of the trials and privations I have referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
to, this book tells that, owing to not being able to
procure a site, the expedient was resorted to of a floating
manse—the “Betsy,” an old boat of 12 tons burden,
which, although very unfit to stand the storms of
the Atlantic, was used by the Rev. Mr. Swanson as
he passed from one stormy shore to another amongst
the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and has been
immortalized by Hugh Miller in his interesting book,
<i>The Cruise of the “Betsy.”</i></p>

<p>I had written the greater part of these “Bits,” and
was asking a friend for information on a kindred
subject, when he drew my attention to the <i>Annals</i>; and
since I have perused the book, I add my humble
testimony to the admirable manner in which it presents
the interesting and well-told tales of those
recent Scottish worthies.</p>

<p>The story of the determined adherence of these
suffering witnesses to their conscientious convictions
in the face of ill-treatment and persecution, reached
Blinkbonny, and it awakened not only a burst of
indignation towards those who did the wrong, but it
provoked a feeling which manifested itself in substantial
help, as well as sympathetic admiration towards
those who suffered the wrong; and to this
cause, coupled with the high esteem in which Mr.
Barrie was held, quite as much as to an intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
adherence to any well-thought-out theory of church
government, may be attributed the strong hold that
the Free Church took of Blinkbonny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ONE TOUCH OF NATURE.</i></div>

<p>The touch of tyranny laid on those distant members
of the “body, the Church,” travelled like an electric
current, and proved in the case of those members
more happily situated to be the touch of nature, in
making them feel more and more “kin” to “the
bound as bound with them;” and the result was
that they stood by them, and by the principles they
contended for, so firmly, that those through whom the
offence came ceased their violent dealings, and found
that the wave of truth, and principle, and progress</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rolled not back when Canute gave command.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Only those who know Scotch village life well
could believe how much of its variety, and interest,
and conversation centres in the churches. There is
often little else to gather the folks together, and
such questions as, “Who’s to be assisting you? Is
your own man at home just now? Does he belong to
‘oor body’? Where did he sit in Stirling? Will he
be coming among us?” required nothing more to
be said to convey to nearly everybody that they
were questions about the Church.</p>

<p>A site was easily found for the Free church in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Blinkbonny, and a church, on what was then known
as the Tanfield Hall plan, a plain building of small
gables and no architectural pretensions, was ready
for occupation before the winter had fairly set in.
Previous to this, a regular congregation had been
formed. The majority of the elders had “come out”
with Mr. Barrie, so that the session was easily made
up. The Free Church also revived what most of
the other churches in Scotland had overlooked or
discarded, viz. the order of deacons, whose special
function is to attend to the secular affairs of the
congregation, and who are solemnly “ordained and
set apart” for that important work; and to this
more complete carrying out of the apostolical practice
may be attributed much of the success which has
attended the financial schemes of the Free Church,
as it brought into her service the active, the shrewd,
the prudent, and the willing, and provided a congenial
sphere for the exercise of their talents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOMELY COMMENTARY.</i></div>

<p>The Session has as its special province the spiritual
affairs of the congregation, and as the higher court
it affords greater scope for the exercise of the gifts
of utterance, readiness in the Scriptures, etc., on
behalf of the members generally, but particularly
towards the afflicted, the weary, the backsliding, or
the erring. The Session is, besides, associated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
the Deacons’ Court in the superintendence, or at least
the regulation, of the secular affairs; and there is
thereby secured a combination, which old George
Brown characterized, on the occasion of the proposal
to elect the first deacons in Blinkbonny, thus: “What
I said after the meetin’ in the hall on the Saturday
after Mr. Barrie cam’ hame was, ‘As it were the
company of two armies,’ but I didna think o’ the
Deacons’ Court at the time. But I’ve been readin’
the Acks o’ the Apostles, an’ I find that the want
o’ deacons hindered the very apostles; but when they
got them the murmuring was not only stoppit, but
the number o’ the disciples increased greatly, an’ even
a great company o’ the very priests, the unlikeliest of
all kinds o’ folks, were added to the Church. I wonder
what for every kirk hasna deacons? Maybe it’s because
Stephens an’ Philips are ill to find; and I’m inclined to
think that we’ll a’ find that we’ve a great deal to learn
about how to conduct kirk business o’ a’ kinds.”</p>

<p>I became a member of the first deacons’ court.</p>

<p>When our church was fit for use, we parted from
our Secession friends with a grateful sense of their
generous treatment of us, which we expressed as
warmly as we could, and there is still existing
much kindly interchange of brotherly affection between
the two congregations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<p>When we opened the new church, we were
especially gratified at the readiness with which
several persons offered to place themselves at the
disposal of the congregation, according to their ideas
of what they could do. The appointment of a church
officer or beadle was brought up at a congregational
meeting; but it was very quickly settled by Walter
Dalgleish, a jobbing gardener, who had been from the
first a staunch adherent of the Free Church. “Ye’ll
need nae paid beadles,” said Walter, rising half off
his seat; “I’ll serve ye in that capacity if ye’ll alloo
me, and be proud to do’t for naething.”</p>

<p>He proved a capital beadle, and when the funds
were prosperous he was offered a salary. His answer
to this proposal was unanswerable. “Christian friends,”
said he, “I’ve been mair than paid already. Me an’ ma
household have had what we read o’ in Second Samuel,
sixth chapter an’ twalth verse, how the Lord blessed
Obed-edom an’ all his household, when the ark rested
in his house for three months. If ye’re pleased wi’
me, just let me do as I’ve been doing; or tell me
hoo I can do better, an’ ye’ll no’ need to tell me
twice if I can help it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>MUSIC HATH CHARMS.</i>”</div>

<p>For the leading of the psalmody, the precentorship,
there were several ready offerers. Of these, Andrew
Taylor, the son of Mr. Taylor, the elder already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
spoken of, most frequently occupied the “desk,” as
the precentor’s seat was called (sometimes, however,
the “bunker”). On one occasion it was the “turn”
of his worthy father to stand at the “plate” in
the lobby where the “collection” was made, along
with a deacon named William Morrison, who was by
trade a joiner, and had been working for the greater
part of the summer in a neighbouring county at a
new mansion-house. Andrew Taylor had a good voice
of considerable power and sweetness, and William
Morrison did not know that he was to lead the
singing that day. As soon as his clear, silvery tone
caught the deacon’s ear, he turned quickly to Mr.
Taylor, and said, “Wha’s that that’s precentin’?”</p>

<p>“It’s our Andrew,” said Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>“Your Andrew, Mr. Taylor!” said William, extending
his hand; and taking Mr. Taylor’s, he shook it warmly.
“Your Andrew! Ah, Maister Taylor, Maister Taylor,
it’s glorious a’thegither! It’s by-ordinar’ grand to
see sae mony finding out that they’re like the thousand
an’ seven hunder an’ threescore in the ninth o’
First Chronicles, ‘very able men for the work of the
service of the house of God,’ that were clean idle
before. Eh, Maister Taylor, Maister Taylor! I maun
join in,—I can<i>not</i> help mysel’.”</p>

<p>And these two men, standing at the plate in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
lobby opposite the outer door, sent their voices into
the street, for they knew the Psalms too well to need
any book; and the appropriate words added strength
to their lungs as they sang part of the 144th Psalm
to the tune “New London”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That, as the plants, our sons may be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In youth grown up that are;</div>
    <div class="verse indentx">Our daughters like to corner-stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Carved like a palace fair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I may here state that not the least observable
matter in the new state of things was the additional
meaning and force found in the Psalms of David.
Possibly they are best adapted for a militant, progressive,
almost agitated state of the Church. In our
parish church, by the same people, they had been
listlessly sung and seldom “entered into;” but in the
new church, even in the reading of them by the
minister, there was new light thrown on old psalms.
Many in the congregation could be seen giving an
appreciative nod, and if nearer them, you would have
heard a very slight “hem,” which meant, “I didn’t
observe that before.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PSALMS AND HYMNS.</i></div>

<p>There was possibly a tendency to apply to present
circumstances what suited other and often all times;
at all events, the psalms were sung with intense feeling.
To specify the favourites would be to copy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
great part of the Book of Psalms. If anything, the
nineties had the palm, but the forty-sixth—“God is
our refuge and our strength,” Luther’s “<i>Ein Feste
Burg</i>”—became as popular with us as it had been in
Germany.</p>

<p>Perhaps this may account for the slow progress
which hymns made for many years in Scotland.
Many of these noble compositions of Christian genius
are now used as vehicles of praise, and they unquestionably
have their place and power in the service of
song; but the older folks still maintain that they want
“grup;” and the early Scottish Church found ample
material for expressing its aspirations or presenting
its tribute of grave sweet melody in the old Psalms of
David.</p>

<p>For Mr. Barrie the summer was one of special
excitement. He was much occupied with his own
congregation, and with the affairs of the Free Church
of Scotland generally. He had always been a studious
man, was a fair scholar, and had given conscientious
attention to his preparations for the pulpit, and to the
visitation of the sick. But he now appeared to have
got new life, and an increased power of penetration
into many parts of the Christian’s duty. Instead of
relaxing what is called in Scotland discipline, or
lowering the terms of communion, he was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
emphatic than ever in pressing on all, especially on
advanced young persons, not to profess what they did
not feel. He seemed a man absorbed in his Master’s
work, and his former reading experience and observation
became a magazine whence he could draw for
his ready service illustration, incentive, or appeal.</p>

<p>He not only surprised others, but he was a wonder
to himself. Thoughts flowed in on him as he prepared
himself in the study for pulpit work; light broke
in so as to surprise and refresh him; parts of Scripture
that seemed barren before, were now bristling
with meaning and practical lessons. What surprised
him most was that he hardly ever looked into commentaries
or books of systematic theology. The
circumstances of himself and his people became so
real to him, that nearly every verse he read seemed to
suggest a good text for a sermon; and his difficulty
was in arranging his ministrations so as to give to
each part its proportionate share of attention.</p>

<p>“I seem to myself to be,” said he to a brother
minister, “like the lame man at the Beautiful gate of
the temple. Up till now I have been lame from my
mother’s womb; but I feel as if my feet and ankle
bones had received strength, and now it is with me
more like walking, and leaping, and praising God.”</p>

<p>His fears as to the support of his family, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
been so very trying to him, were now gone; and
although he did little in the way of directly stimulating
congregational liberality, he in the course of
his preaching showed, what few of us had noticed
before, the great prominence that giving to God’s
cause has both in the Old and New Testaments, and
its reflex influence on the Church. This went to the
hearts of the people, and they offered willingly. During
the first year the congregation raised more than had
been collected in the Established church of the parish
for fifty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>OVER AGAINST THE TREASURY.</i>”</div>

<p>Over Scotland much of the same spirit existed.
The continuous rain of £1000 a-day, as Dr. Chalmers
called it, kept pouring on,—so much so that those
who were looked on as martyrs in ’43, were
spoken of as heroes in ’44. Indeed, their heroism,
like all other heroism, was by many considered
rashness; and when they undertook to erect schools
as well as churches, it was thought that the “ship
would soon get over-freighted and go to the bottom;”
but it seemed as if the more they attempted, the more
they prospered, until, like the Israelites in Egypt, the
people multiplied and waxed very mighty.</p>

<p>Well do I remember the evening of our first annual
soiree. The treasurer’s report told of some £400
paid, and other £300 promised. As soon as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
finished, Mr. Barrie stood up, and without book,
without even giving out the number of the psalm,
repeated with great vigour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When Sion’s bondage God turn’d back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like men that dream’d were we;</div>
    <div class="verse indentx">Then filled with laughter was our mouth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our tongue with melody,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singing <i>was</i> hearty.</p>

<p>The experience of hundreds of Free churches in
Scotland was similar to that of Blinkbonny; and
when we consider that the members were a moiety
of what those of the Established Church had been
previous to the Disruption, and that they had not
been trained to systematic giving (for it is matter of
history that the contributions of the Church of Scotland
previous to 1843, for charitable and religious
purposes, were utterly disproportionate to her wealth,
and fell far short of what the Dissenters of the period
raised), we are the more struck with the stream of
devout and intelligent liberality which flowed into
the Free Church treasury steadily and continually,
and which is still flowing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MORE TO FOLLOW.</i></div>

<p>The years 1844–1847 were severe years for the
country. Owing to the potato disease and consequent
dulness of trade, poverty and want came to many
a door, and hundreds not only denied themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
luxuries, but many things formerly considered necessaries
were more sparingly used, in order to alleviate
the distresses of suffering Ireland and the Highlands,
as well as the general poor; and instead of the one
call interfering with the other, both were promptly
and nobly met, to an extent that would have been
declared unattainable a few years before.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from making special mention of
the cause of foreign missions. It can readily be
supposed that with churches, and manses, and in
many places schools, to build, and the ministry to
support by spontaneous contributions, with no fixed
source of income, and little experience of voluntary
liberality, the Free Church would have had so much
to do at home that there was neither call nor means
to undertake foreign mission work.</p>

<p>The mission question was a perplexing one. The
missionaries of the Church of Scotland, being out of
the arena of immediate conflict, yet conversant with
the matters in dispute, were as well qualified as any
men could be to judge of the points of contention;
and their decision as to whether they would declare
themselves as adhering to the Established or Free
Church, was anxiously looked for.</p>

<p>To all human appearance the Free Church could do
nothing for them,—certainly could guarantee nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
However willing their spirit might he, their flesh
seemed in this matter helplessly weak. Moreover,
the “Non-Intrusion” matter was a home question,
and did not directly affect the missionaries, and the
Established Church had still great wealth and power
without any such extra call on her resources.</p>

<p>The decision of the missionaries was unanimously
and resolutely in favour of the Free Church. When
this fact was announced to the Assembly at its meeting
in Glasgow in the autumn of 1843, it created
intense excitement. The enthusiasm was indescribable.
For some minutes the meeting was a Babel
of cheering, and shouts of joy, and mutual congratulations,
friend rushing to friend to relieve their feelings
by violent shakings of hands; and every now and
again during the meeting the pent-up gladness exploded
vociferously.</p>

<p>The Free Church had already undertaken enormous
responsibilities. Would they assume this additional
one? Dared they? Was it not a question of the
certain king who had ten thousand soldiers to meet
twenty thousand? Had they a clear call to go
forward? It was a solemn question. Yes required
strong—very strong faith. Would they say Yes?
No was the loud answer of sight,—clearly, unquestionably,
No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>FROM POLE TO POLE.</i></div>

<p>The foundation of the Home Church had been laid
in a way that was wonderful in their eyes. Was the
building ready for this grand cope-stone?</p>

<p>“It will crush it to atoms,” said the adversary.</p>

<p>“Never!” was the triumphant reply. “Who art
thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
become a plain; and he shall bring forth the headstone
thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto
it!” And the support of the missionaries and mission
stations was undertaken with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All the funds collected for the mission cause were
of course in the hands of the Church of Scotland, and retained
by it, although these had been largely supplied by
those who now formed the Free Church. The mission
premises abroad were also kept by them, and even the
mission libraries and educational appliances, although
these had been mostly brought together by the personal
efforts or friends of the missionaries, so that the Free
Church got the living men only.</p>

<p>This was according to the <i>letter</i> of the law, but
many of the best men in the Established Church
strongly insisted on the funds, etc. being partly
apportioned to the Free Church, and that the property
should go with the missionaries, as equity and consistency
alike indicated, even in the things that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Cæsar’s. A reverend father of the Established Church
thus expressed himself on this subject:</p>

<p>“The question yet to be settled is, are they ours?
Did I say yet to be settled? That depends on the
court in which the question is tried. In the highest
court, the decision of the greater than Solomon would
be in this matter in favour of the Free Church.
‘Give her the living child, she is the mother thereof;’
this has already been done, and it is a mean thing
to send her empty away.”</p>

<p>When it was proposed to contribute regularly for
foreign missions in Blinkbonny, the more experienced
members deemed it inexpedient until our home affairs
were put on a sure basis, but some of the ladies
espoused the cause keenly. They with some difficulty
prevailed on Mr. Taylor to introduce the subject
at a general meeting. His speech was far from being
hearty; it was a mere question, “Could the members
give to any scheme they liked?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the chairman.</p>

<p>“Well, there are some that want to give to the missionaries,
and I think we should appoint a committee.”</p>

<p>This was done, and before a year had passed £42 were
collected. Strange to say, the other schemes seemed to
suffer so little, that even George Brown, who was one of
the most timid, “thocht the folk were made o’ siller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GUDE SILLER.</i></div>

<p>How different this was from what we had done for
missions in the old Church! I remember of the well-to-do
farmer of Ramsay lands asking me for two sixpences
for a shilling, adding, “Isna this a collection for
the missionaries? I fancy we’ll hae to gi’e them a saxpence.”
Next week he gave to a curling club a silver
medal.</p>

<p>He was justly esteemed as a good, kind man, but
his “saxpence” not unfairly represents the ideas of
the times on the subject of missions.</p>

<p>It took a considerable time to reconcile the older
folks to the exercise of missionary liberality. As I
was coming from a meeting in which the missionary
treasurer had announced that there had been collected
for foreign missions during the previous year upwards
of £42, James Wilkie, an old gamekeeper, spoke thus:</p>

<p>“Mr. Martin, did I hear richt, think ye? did our
treasurer say that we (?) had gathered forty-twa pound
for thae missionars?”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said I; “forty-two pounds odds,
James.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great heap o’ siller,” said he; “div ye no’
really think that it’s a pity to see a’ that gude siller
gaun out o’ the country?”</p>

<p>I will close this chapter with two reminiscences of
Dr. Duff in the Free Church General Assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>The Home Mission report was being commented on
by Sheriff Monteith. He said that home missions had
not the romance about them that foreign missions
had.</p>

<p>Dr. Duff sprang to his feet with a bound like a
tiger springing on its prey, and said something like
this:</p>

<p>“Romance, sir! Romance did I hear you say!—romance?
Are the burning suns of India romance?
leaving home and kindred, and ease and comfort,
romance? exposing your family to the horrors of
heathenism, romance?” At each sentence he stepped
nearer Sheriff Monteith, until, while saying something
rather personal about not leaving his comfortable table
to visit the dens of infamy in the Cowgate, his clenched
fist was dangerously near the Sheriff’s face. It was
not a long speech, but the look of burning indignation
with which he delivered it, and the energy of his
gesticulation, told powerfully. At the last words,
“Romance, forsooth!” he sat down exhausted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FLOWERS O’ THE FOREST.</i></div>

<p>Never was “oil thrown on the waters” with more
quiet force and effect than by Dr. Buchanan on that
occasion. A few words sufficed, words of remarkable
dignity and tenderness, and at their close he took Sheriff
Monteith by the one hand, and Dr. Duff by the other,
and with great heartiness they shook hands on the platform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of the Assembly amidst the loud applause of the
audience. I thought then, and I think yet, that I
never saw three as fine-looking, noble-hearted Christian
gentlemen,—certainly never grouped on such a
striking occasion. It seemed to me to be a living
group representing Faith, Hope, Charity, but I would
not undertake to determine which was which.</p>

<p>My other reminiscence is of the evening meeting
after the union of the Free Church with the Original
Secession Church. I can recall Dr. Duff’s massive,
sunburnt face, his thick, erect, bristling hair, and his
perfervid eloquence.</p>

<p>He spoke of looking out on his return from India
for the grand old ministers he used to meet in his
younger days. “Where were Dr. Andrew Thomson,
Dr. David Dickson, old Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Crie, Dr. Chalmers?” Not
in the haunts of living men. He had to go to the
graveyards and content himself with honouring their
memories; and it made him feel as if</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The flowers o’ the forest were a’ wede away.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when he returned to the familiar streets, he forgot
his grief as he saw Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Crie, the worthy son of a
worthy father, Dr. John Brown, Dr. Grey, Dr. Glover,
and such men carrying aloft the standard of the
Master. Truly great was the multitude that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
published the good news in Scotland, but what of India
with its tens of millions? How was the Church discharging
its duty to the heathen world?</p>

<p>He then said with a persuasive smile: “A mother
in Scotland thus showed her loyalty for an earthly
prince:</p>

</div>

<p>Why not the same, why not greater devotion to the
Prince of Peace, the King of kings? I ask not the
tens, although that would be but right, but in this
day of small things I ask but one in ten.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap-a">ALTHOUGH Mr. Walker found, when he came to
the parish of Blinkbonny, that the congregation
was very much smaller than it had been under Mr.
Barrie, he did not manifest a spirit of rivalry towards
the Free Church; and, as his pulpit work did not
require much preparation, owing to his having a good
stock of sermons to fall back on, he set himself first
to visit every house in the parish. He was a kind,
sensible, neighbourly man, and had a quiet way of
giving useful hints, and, where needed, remonstrances
or reproofs that often produced good effects.</p>

<p>While Mr. Morrison, the Secession minister, was
the best theologian, and Mr. Barrie the best preacher,
Mr. Walker was the best pastor. When one met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Mr. Morrison, he was “complaisant” and heavy.
Mr. Barrie was polite, but he seemed at one time
abstracted, and at another as if he was too late for
some engagement; but Mr. Walker was courteous,
affectionate, interesting, and interested. In their
preaching, Mr. Barrie was the most rousing and
popular, Mr. Morrison the most profound and exegetical,
Mr. Walker the most sympathetic and practical.
Next to the Bible, Mr. Walker’s favourite book for
pulpit preparation was Matthew Henry’s grand old
Commentary. Mr. Morrison, on the other hand, consulted
a great variety of authorities, ranging from
Augustine and the Fathers to Robert Hall. Mr. Barrie
drew largely from Calvin, Boston, Flavel, and the
Puritan divines, as well as from the church historians,
Knox, Neander, d’Aubigné, M<sup>c</sup>Crie, etc.; and between
the three, Blinkbonny was well off for ministers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TO ALL THE COUNTRY DEAR.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Walker took great interest in the administration
of the poor laws, and as a member of the Parochial
Board he pled the cause of the deserving, and firmly
opposed the demands of the indolent or lazy, got up
local flower-shows, and gave cottagers and others
useful hints as to their gardens, so much so that these
became the pride of the place. He was unsparing in
his extermination of all preventable nuisances and
everything injurious to the health of the community,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
tried to get a better play-green for the boys, joined in
the game of curling, and, stout as he was, he was a
tough opponent, but at the same time a very pleasant
man to play with. Although he never intruded his
profession, he never forgot, far less disgraced it, and
Blinkbonny soon came to look on him as the most
useful man in the place—just a very fine man; and
although leisurely in some of his ways, he was well
qualified to take an active part in public affairs.</p>

<p>He seldom passed any remark about the doings of
the Free Church, and those he did pass were of an inoffensive
kind. He did not grumble at their successes,
nor did he show any ill-feeling towards its adherents.
Certainly he wondered at the interest their services
seemed to excite, and the money they could command.
He thought there were too many meetings and evening
services, which might interfere with family and
domestic duties; that they were in danger of spiritual
pride (there he was right); but he thought upon the
whole that good was being done,—at least he hoped so,
and as the minister of the parish, he rejoiced in everything
that promoted its real welfare.</p>

<p>He had a few good sermons, and was especially
proud of a series of lectures on the parables. These
he had commenced to re-deliver, although he did not
do so in strict chronological order. One of his best,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
he thought, was on the Ten Virgins; but he felt crestfallen
when, after asking an old friend’s opinion of it,
he was answered:</p>

<p>“Mr. Walker, I’ve heard that lecture twenty years
ago, and middling often since then. The virgins are
auld maids by this time; ye should either marry them
off or let them alane.”</p>

<p>The lecture Mr. Walker thought his very best was
about the sower going out to sow. It was a congenial
subject, as he had given agriculture very great attention,
and he actually made it into two lectures, thus
spreading it over two Sabbaths. He had preached
the first half, and intimated that on next Sabbath he
would resume the subject, and hoped to conclude it.
Unluckily for him, an eminent clergyman from
Edinburgh was to preach in the Free church on that
day, and for the first time he felt chagrined at seeing
a very small audience in his church.</p>

<p>He said to his candid friend John Tait, on the
following Monday, “that he was sorry to see so
few folk in church yesterday. If I know myself at
all, I feed my people with the finest of the wheat,
and my memory of what Mr. M<sup>c</sup>—— was at college
and in the hall is, that he was an indifferent scholar,
although a showy speaker.”</p>

<p>Johnnie’s reply was at least honest: “Oh ay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Mr. Walker, nae doubt, nae doubt ye gi’e us as ye ca’t
the finest o’ the wheat; but our wife bakes the best
wheat scones in the kintra-side, and even they are the
better o’ a little butter or jelly or honey to them; and
maybe ye’re a wee scrimpit o’ that sort o’ kitchen to
mak’ your substantial fare mair toothsomer.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>ON HOUSEHOLD CARES INTENT.</i>”</div>

<p>Between Mr. Barrie and Mr. Walker the intercourse
was cordial, although not familiar. And Bell
got reconciled to Mr. Walker, and even jealous of
him when she saw that the manse garden and park
were fully as productive as they had been under her
management, although not quite so tidy.</p>

<p>The miracle already referred to, of how Mrs. Barrie
could do what she did, and as she did it, on the income
they had, still continued to exercise the wondering
attention of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The flitting had been attended with considerable
expense. Some new things had to be got for Knowe
Park. The children were growing up, and the boys
were, like all healthy boys, “heavy” on their clothes;
and besides, Mr. Barrie was a liberal contributor for
the maintenance of ordinances and the erection of
the new church.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie, seconded by her faithful Bell, stuck to
her thrifty practices and household duties, whilst at
the same time she took great interest in all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
concerned the church, and by her good sense and motherly
counsel quietly did much useful work. She made Mr.
Barrie her first worldly care, and this enabled him to
overtake his arduous duties timeously and efficiently.</p>

<p>Bell was as constantly diligent as ever, working
away in the house, amongst her live stock, and in
getting the garden up to her standard. When the
winter evenings set in, she kept stitching away,
trying to keep the boys all right; for that was her
special department, as Mrs. Barrie attended to the
girls’ attire. The wires for knitting stockings were
nimbly plied at all spare hours; and as she could read
and knit at the same time, she became well up in
Free Church matters, as she got a “look of the newspapers”
in the evening. She paid little attention to the
general news, but perused with great interest “a’thing
about kirks.” She also read with much care all the
Free Church magazines.</p>

<p>When November term came, Mrs. Barrie, as she
had generally done, put into an envelope Bell’s half-yearly
wages, or “fee” as Bell called it, and handed
the parcel to Bell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RATHER TOO MUCH.</i></div>

<p>There was an understanding between them that
there was to be no “speakin’ at the ‘speakin’ time,’”
that is, no asking Bell if she was “stayin’.” Mrs.
Barrie had done this for the first three years, but Bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
beseeched her not to do it again,—“she couldna bide
it; if she wasna gaun to stop, she wad gi’e plenty
warnin’.” And although Bell’s fee had been increased
more than once, she had never asked an advance, nor
had Mrs. Barrie ever told her of it beforehand; indeed,
the payment of the fee seemed to be the most trying
part of the intercourse between Mrs. Barrie and Bell,
from the strange feeling that some fine natures have
when money matters are referred to. Not only was
there little said on such occasions, but Bell felt at a
loss for words to thank Mrs. Barrie for raising her fee.
She seldom got past “it’s far ower kind—far ower kind,
’deed is’t.” And Mrs. Barrie felt the same difficulty,
for her reply rarely exceeded, “It’s not that, Bell; I
wish”—Then she passed on to some other subject,
and both seemed to be relieved, and to enter afresh
on another six months’ unclouded intercourse.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, Mrs. Barrie was surprised
at Bell’s troubled look, and more so at her
words.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barrie,” said Bell, handing her back the
money, “I canna tak’ it, and I daurna tak’ it. Dinna
be angry at me, an’ oh, mem, dinna press me. This has
been a heavy half-year on ye, an’ if I daur’d offer ye
what little I hae, I wad gladly gi’e a’ my ‘stockin’ fittie;”
for an old rig-and-fur stocking was Bell’s purse, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
kept it for safety in the bottom of the case of the
kitchen clock, covered up with an old dirty dusty
wrapper, the only regularly dusty thing in her
kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie thoroughly appreciated Bell’s generous
thoughtfulness, and although she was put about by it,
she tried to keep this from Bell.</p>

<p>“Bell,” said Mrs. Barrie, “you’re exceedingly kind,
it’s very thoughtful indeed of you; it’s just like yourself.
But I’m thankful to say that there is not the slightest
need for your perplexing yourself about us, for we’ve
enough and to spare, so please say no more about the
matter; but thank you very much, Bell, all the same.”</p>

<p>Bell was loth to yield, and only did so after
repeated pressing. Mrs. Barrie left the kitchen, and
had hardly sat down in the parlour, when Bell came
in, and laying a one-pound note on the table, said:</p>

<p>“Ye’ve countit wrang, mem, if you please; ye’ve
gi’en me a pound ower much.”</p>

<p>“No, Bell, not too much,” said Mrs. Barrie; “too
little if you like, but not too much. You told me
just now it had been a heavy half-year with us.
What has it been to you? You have done two
women’s work.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>TWICE BLESSED.</i>”</div>

<p>“No’ me, Mrs. Barrie, no’ me. I have a gude place,
an’s no oppressed nae way. Twae women’s wark?—pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
their men or their mistresses! It’s nae wark at
a’; naebody meddles wi’ me; I dae as I like.”</p>

<p>“Because you always like to do well, Bell.”</p>

<p>“I wish I did,” said Bell, and was leaving the
room, when Mrs. Barrie said: “Take the pound with
you, Bell.”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Barrie; excuse me, mem,” said Bell. “I
never disobeyed ye before, but I will not take that
pound—I could not take it.”</p>

<p>“Do what you like with it, Bell, but pray take it
away; it’s yours.”</p>

<p>Bell lifted it, and said, “For His cause.” Her
fee had been a consecrated thing in her mind for some
time, and seeing Mrs. Barrie had declined it, Bell,
with great comfort to herself, apportioned it between
the Building, Sustentation, and Mission Funds of the
Free Church; with the exception of one pound, with
which she bought “Alloa yarn,” and knitted cosy
under-garments for the whole household, herself
excepted. She did this at odd times, almost by
stealth; and on New-Year’s day, when each inmate
was wishing Bell a happy New Year, she put into
their hands the cosy clothing, saying, “That’s your
hansel;” but in the case of Mrs. Barrie it was varied
by, “That’s pairt o’ yon pound.”</p>

<p>Bell’s cookery is a subject I cannot handle as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
should be handled. I have occasionally heard her tell
of the regular winter Sabbath-day dinner as follows:</p>

<p>“There’s nothing beats a sheep’s head. We hae ane
every Sabbath; it’s cheap, and very handy. There’s
this gude thing about it, it needs little watchin’,
and disna gang wrang wi’ ower lang boilin’: cleek it
on, an’ get it fair through the boil, then cleek it up
so as it’ll no’ boil ower an’ pit oot the fire, an’ ye may
lock the door an’ gang a’ to the kirk, an’ come oot
when you like. It disna matter for an hour or twa,
either; ’deed it’s a’ the better o’ plenty o’ the fire—especially
if ye hae a handfu’ o’ the ‘blue pat-pea’ in’t,
an’ plenty barley. Then what’s like the broth on a
cauld day? An’ then there’s the tongue for the bairns,
an’ the head for the big folks. I like the feet best
mysel’ [that’s like you, Bell]; an’ the broth’s grand
next day—they’re a denner themsel’s.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AFTER MEG DODS.</i></div>

<p>In cooking potatoes Bell could boil them till they
were ragged in the “jackets,” but “mealy” all through;
bake them in the oven with their skins on, so that
with a little salt butter they were like eggs, and
“suppit” as eggs are; fry them till they were “delicious;”
beat and brown them with a little milk so as
to render them a satisfying meal. Moreover, with the
addition of a little dried fish, cod or ling, eggs or odd
scraps, she made such dainty dishes as I cannot get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
reproduced. Possibly the potato disease may account
for this.</p>

<p>I can speak from experience of her wonderful
success with salt herrings,—“food for a king,” as Mr.
Taylor used to say,—and am tempted to speak of her
stews and “hashes,” and haggises and white puddings;
for these were never too rich, but palatable, digestible,
and tempting, and often they were made out of what
modern cooks would put aside as unfit for family use.
Out of common pot barley she made a delightful
pudding, that beat rice pudding hollow. But I must
not make this a cookery-book.</p>

<p>I asked Bell for some receipts on one occasion.</p>

<p>“There’s nae receipt about it, Mr. Martin,” said she;
“just gang richt aboot it, an’ ye canna miss. It’s just
as easy as A-B-buff when ye’re into the way o’t.”</p>

<p>“Just so, Bell; but how do ye get into the way
o’t?”</p>

<p>“Tuts, Mr. Martin,” said Bell playfully, “that’s no’
a man-body’s parish; and as the sayin’ is, ‘Hunger’s
gude kitchen;’ altho’, in ma way o’ thinkin’, there’s as
muckle, if no’ mair, lies wi’ the cook as wi’ the flesher,—it
are thae.”</p>

<p>Bell had always on hand what cooks call “stock,”
on which she could fall back as occasion required for
soups and gravies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>

<p>On a bitterly cold day, a Mr. Kirkwood called at
Knowe Park by the desire of a Colonel Gordon, to make
inquiries as to his relationship to Mrs. Barrie, whose
maiden name, as already stated, was Mary Gordon.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie was from home, and the family dinner
was, in Bell’s phrase, an “offpit;” and Mrs. Barrie,
knowing this, expressed her regret that she could
hardly ask Mr. Kirkwood to join them at their homely
meal, as the chief dish was plain potato-soup.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood’s face brightened at the familiar name,
which reminded him of his early home; for he had
been abroad for over thirty years, and had only recently
returned to Scotland to spend the evening of his days.</p>

<p>“Potato-soup!” said he; “ah, that recalls old times.
If it is not presuming on your hospitality, I would like
immensely to renew my acquaintance with a very old
favourite.”</p>

<p>“With great pleasure,” said Mrs. Barrie, as she
showed him into the parlour.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>POT-LUCK.</i></div>

<p>It would be unjust to call Mr. Kirkwood a gourmand,
but he was an epicure, fastidious in culinary matters,
and an authority in gastronomics. He was accordingly
helped to the soup. One spoonful brought a smile,
partly of surprise, but quite as much of delight, to his
face; the second confirmed the favourable verdict, and
the contents of the plate soon disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>He looked at Mrs. Barrie, slightly moved his plate,
and said hesitatingly, “May I presume?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” said Mrs. Barrie. “I’m so pleased
that you relish the soup; it is quite the weather for
doing so.”</p>

<p>Plate number two was more leisurely emptied, with
certain appreciative motions of the lips and face, and
he again cast a lingering look towards the tureen, and
said: “Excuse me, madam, I assure you that I never
tasted any soup equal to this, although my knocking
about the world has familiarized me with nearly every
sort and every style of cookery. It’s superb; it’s simply
magnificent. Would it be outraging the laws of politeness?”
He had again slightly lifted his plate. Mrs.
Barrie was greatly pleased, and served out plate
number three with her happiest smile, for the table
was now a merry one.</p>

<p>When the third plate was finished, she jocularly
refilled the soup divider, and, looking toward him, said,
“Do allow me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood, who was in great good humour,
said: “You are very kind, and I feel as if I could relish
more, but we must draw the line somewhere, so no
more, thank you. But pray, Mrs. Barrie, may I ask if
your cook would favour me with the receipt?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any,” said Mrs. Barrie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>“Then may I see your cook?”</p>

<p>“We have only one maid-of-all-work,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then she’s a treasure. May I see her?”</p>

<p>“Certainly;” and Bell was called in.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood rather confused Bell by abruptly
asking, “How ever did you make this magnificent
soup, cook? I never had anything equal to it.”</p>

<p>Bell saw that he was in earnest, and that Mrs.
Barrie seemed in great spirits, so she at once said:</p>

<p>“It’s just ordinary pitattie soup, but the day I had
a ham bone, an’ the stock was gude; an’ ma way is
aye boil the pitatties separate, then pour them, then
beat them, or as we ca’d ‘champ’ them, and add them to
the stock, and steer and mix them weel, an’ be sure
that baith them an’ the plates is hett.”</p>

<p>“Ordinary soup!” said Mr. Kirkwood; “that’s a
matter of opinion; my idea is that it is the <i>ne plus
ultra</i>.”</p>

<p>“The what?” said Bell “What kind o’ apples?”</p>

<p>“Ask this young gentleman,” said Mr. Kirkwood,
looking to James; “he’s doubtless a Latin scholar. My
translation is ‘the top of the tree,’ ‘the head sheaf,’
the ‘never was beat,’ the <i>crême-de-la-crême</i>;” and Mr.
Kirkwood left in great spirits, warmly thanking Mrs.
Barrie and Bell, both of whom were much amused by
the little incident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>James gave Bell the literal translation of <i>ne plus
ultra</i>, viz. “nothing more beyond,” “nothing better,”
not a little proud of having been called in as interpreter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE AULD SCOTTISH KAIL BROSE.</i></div>

<p>Mrs. Barrie, knowing that Bell was well acquainted
with her family history, told her that Mr. Kirkwood
had been making inquiries about her father, at the
request of some Colonel Gordon, and asked Bell if she
knew anything about the Colonel or Mr. Kirkwood.</p>

<p>Bell said no, but that Dan Corbett was coming to
see about something in the afternoon (it was to kill
the pig, but Bell was too well bred to put it so plainly),
and she would ask him, as he “kenn’d a’ the folk round
aboot; and Dan will be divertit when I tell him that
Mr. Kirkwood said oor pitattie soup was like his game
fowls, for he spake o’ them as ‘never was beat,’ an’
‘the top o’ the tree.’ I’ve been thinkin’ that he micht
mean that they were half pitattie soup, and half
‘cockie-leekie.’”</p>

<p>After Dan’s immediate work was over at Knowe Park,
he was a good deal surprised when Bell asked him to
“come in and get a cup o’ tea, for it was a cauld nicht,
an’ she wantit to speak to him aboot twa or three ither
things;” and he was even more astonished when Bell
sat down with him. He had the diffidence sometimes
so strongly developed in an outcast, and it was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
difficulty that he was persuaded to draw even his chair
near the table. What had taken Bell to be so gracious
he could not think, nor could she. There was a something
that had led her to look on Dan of late with
pity, then with interest, then with a desire to try “an’
mak’ something o’ the puir creatur’;” and to-night she
actually went the length of saying, “As it was very
stormy ootside, he micht smoke in the kitchen if he
wad blaw the smoke up the chimney as much as he
could.”</p>

<p>Dan’s first remark after tea was over, and after he
had gauged the angle at which to deliver the smoke
into the chimney, was, “I think ye’ll find Knowe Park
fit ye fine, but I canna comprehend what gar’d Mr.
Barrie leave the auld manse.”</p>

<p>Bell tried to explain the matter, but the points were
far too fine for Dan’s rough-and-ready way of reasoning,
and he said:</p>

<p>“I wad ’a been very sorra if I had been him. The
Government as ye speak o’ wasna meddlin’ wi’ <i>him</i>,
and he was weel likit; an’ they say this new kirk is
takin’ a heap o’ siller. <i>I</i> wad ’a bidden in the auld
ane.”</p>

<p>“He couldna dae that for his principles, although
we a’ left the auld manse, as ye ca’d, wi’ a heavy heart;”
and Bell spoke to Dan at considerable length about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the Disruption, and the family, and brought in “wee
Nellie” and her death, and her grave in the old kirkyard
very touchingly.</p>

<p>“Aweel,” said Dan, “I think ye were the mair
fules to leave. Maister Walker’s a nice man, but so is
Mr. Barrie; and for a’ I can see, the tane is exactly
the same as the tither. Wad Mr. Barrie no gang back
yet?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Bell warmly; “ye may as weel try to
lift the milkin’ stane o’ Dumbarton!”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> The name given to an enormous mass of rock, which according to
local tradition fell from the Castle rock into the cow park of primitive
Dumbarton. One or more women who were milking their cows are
said to have been smothered by it: if that is the case, the guide may
safely assert that their bodies are there yet, as the “milking stone”
will weigh thousands of tons.</p>

</div>

<div class="leftnote"><i>DUMBARTON.</i></div>

<p>As Bell said this, Dan’s pipe dropped out of his
cheek, and he gave a nervous start; his only eye fixed
itself on Bell with more than usual firmness, and he
said, “What do ye ken about the milkin’ stane o’
Dumbarton?”</p>

<p>“I come frae Dumbarton; sae does Mrs. Barrie: did
ye no’ ken that afore, Dan?”</p>

<p>“No me,” said Dan; “hoo could I ken’d till ye
tell’t me? I never thocht on the matter at a’; it was
nae business o’ mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bell, “the mistress was a daughter, the
only daughter, o’ Mr. Gordon o’ the Grainaries.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>
<p>Dan rose in intense excitement, and said, “Preserve
me, I maun awa’ Bell; dinna speak to me ony mair
about that, I canna bear’t the noo. Oh, let me gang!
let me gang!”</p>

<p>Bell was astonished at Dan’s sudden excitement,
and could see no reason for it; so, recollecting about
Mr. Kirkwood, she said, “Sit doon a minute, an’ I’ll
tell ye a farce that happen’t the day.”</p>

<p>She then told about the potato-soup, and said, “You
that ken’s a’ the folk in the country-side, can ye tell
me onything about that Mr. Kirkwood? He’s been
lang abroad, about India or some o’ thae places.”</p>

<p>Dan, who was now a little quieter, sat down and
said, “That’ll be him that’s bocht ‘Strathgowan.’ I’ve
seen him. He has some braw dougs: he has a mastiff
that I think could fecht ma Burke, an’ <i>he’s</i> no’ easy
bate.”</p>

<p>“By the bye,” said Bell, “he was speirin’ about Mrs.
Barrie’s father.” Bell said this <i>without thinking</i>, and
Dan again started to his feet.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>GENERALSHIP.</i></div>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Dan, but what makes ye sae
wild when I speak o’ auld Mr. Gordon? There’s naebody
here that ye need care for, an’ there’s something
on yer mind, but I canna contrive what it is. Whatever
is’t, Dan?” said Bell, and she tried all the kitchen
doors, to show him that they were closely shut; then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
added, “Sit doon, Dan, an’ gather yersel a wee, for I
promised to the mistress to speak to you about Mr.
Kirkwood.”</p>

<p>Dan swithered and writhed about a little, fixed his
single eye on the kitchen door, twirled his bonnet
in his hands, but at last he sat down, and looked
thoughtfully in the fire.</p>

<p>“That’s wiselike, Dan; that’s like yersel’, Dan,” said
Bell encouragingly; “they say that ye were the best
watcher o’ a kirkyard in the county, and ye’re no’ gaun
to start at naething. Weel, as I was saying, this Mr.
Kirkwood was here the day, for to obleege some
Cornel Gordon that’s come hame frae India, and that
wants to ken about the Gordons o’ the Grainaries, an’
if Mrs. Barrie was ane o’ them.”</p>

<p>Dan, still looking at the fire, said, “Div you ken a’
thing about Mr. Gordon? I never kent till this moment
he was Mrs. Barrie’s father.”</p>

<p>I stated in my first chapter that Mrs. Barrie never
referred to her father’s changed circumstances, and had
asked Bell never to speak of them in Blinkbonny, so
that Dan’s question was a poser. She took a very red
face, and said, “A’thing, Dan? a’thing?” then going
nearer him she whispered, “I ken about the brandy, an’
tobacco, an’ salt, an’ as I see you ken tae, we can
speak freely about it; but mind never breathe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
thing to ony ither mortal whatsomever about Blinkbonny.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Dan, “did ye ever ken wha put the
brandy an’ things there?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bell, “not me; how could I? It never
was ken’d, an’ likely never will be ken’d.”</p>

<p>“Bell,” said Dan, looking steadily in her face, “I
ken, I ken a’ about it, but there’s no anither livin’
man that I ken o’ kens that bit o’t but mysel’; an’
Bell, for your life dinna tell onybody that I tell’d ye.
Never let on to leevin’ about it.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>There was a long pause. Bell was thinking the
matter over, and had more than once been asked by
Dan to promise never to “breathe the thing.” At
length she said solemnly, “I’ll never mention your name
unless I’m sure it’s to benefit Mrs. Barrie; but she said
something about a brother that this Cornel Gordon
had, that had been a wild man in his young days, and
that he had written to the Cornel that if ever he had
it in his power he was to mind Mr. Gordon o’ the
Grainaries, for this brither hadna dune fair someway wi’
him. I think I understand it a’ noo. This brither’s
been are o’ them that hid the smuggled goods in Mr.
Gordon’s cellar,—ane o’ them that the excisemen just
missed by their boat ‘whummlin’ [<i>i.e.</i> capsizing] at the
milkin’ stane, an’ the smugglers got a’ safe away; an’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>although the judges kent fine that worthy Mr. Gordon
wasna to blame, and didna pit him in the jail, the
excise office wadna forgi’e a farden o’ the fine, and
puir Mr. Gordon was a harried, ruined man wi’ it an’
the law expenses, an’ the trial, an’ the scandal o’ the
thing. The folk said that it was a cousin o’ his, that
they used to ca’ ‘the Duke o’ Gordon’ for a nickname,
that put the brandy an’ stuff in the grainaries, for he
kent the place fine, but he never could be laid hands
on after. I see’t a’ noo.”</p>

<p>Dan remained silent for some time, then said, “Ye
may say that, Bell; ye ken’d a’ noo,—a’ but one thing,
an’ that is (but for your life dinna come ower’t), I
helpit to row the boat that the ‘Duke’ escapit in.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS.</i></div>

<p>Bell’s mind was still considering the matter. “I
wonder,” said she, speaking to herself, “if this Cornel
Gordon is a brother o’ the ‘duke’s,’ as they ca’d him?
an’ if he’s no marriet an’ rich? an’ if he means to
mak’ up for his brither’s ill usage o’ the auld folk by
giein’ a’ his siller to Mrs. Barrie? If I thocht that, I
would gi’e Mr. Kirkwood something that wad astonish
him mair than the tattie-soup. D’ye ken, Dan, that I’m
upliftit, fair upliftit—it looks that like the thing?”</p>

<p>Bell’s glee communicated itself to Dan. “If that
was to be the way o’t,” said Dan, “noo that the thing
is lang past an’ gane, an’ they surely canna meddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
me for only rowin’ a boat” (Dan, Dan, only? well, let
it pass), “I micht tell the ‘duke’s’ brither what <i>I</i> kent;
but he’s a cornel, an’ thae sodgers are terrible ill at
the smugglers.”</p>

<p>Bell and Dan agreed to say “nothing to nobody” on
the subject, until they were quite sure that they could
forward Mrs. Barrie’s interest by doing so; and although
some time elapsed before an opportunity occurred of
clearing this affair up, the maintenance of strict secrecy
was enforced by Dan on every occasion on which he
saw Bell, by a significant motion of his arm, accompanied
by, “Mind yon, Bell—Eh, Bell, mind yon!”</p>

<p>While Bell went about her work as heretofore, there
was a strong undercurrent of thought constantly winding
itself round Dan’s connection with Mrs. Barrie’s
father’s misfortunes, or round Mr. Kirkwood and Colonel
Gordon, and they got all mixed up, until she was quite
in a maze. Many a time did she lay down the
stocking she was knitting, and sit idle, thinking the
matter over and over; but somehow she could never
think it out, it only got more twisted and ravelled.
Many a time after such a “brown study” did she
rouse herself with an impatient gesture, and resume
her knitting, saying almost angrily, “This is ridic’lus.
I’m fair donnert [stupid]; I’ll gi’e ower thinkin’ aboot
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>Many a sleepless hour it caused her, and as her
first call in the morning was paid to Daisy, she unburthened
her mind to the unconcerned cow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HOME BUDGET.</i></div>

<p>“Daisy,” she would say, “my pretty lady, I’m fair
bamboozled [utterly confused]. I’ve hardly sleepit a
wink the nicht; that mixty-maxty business o’ Dan an’
the Grainaries an’ the Cornel has been bizz-bizzing
[hum-humming] in my head. If I could but see
Cornel Gordon his lane [alone] I could pit it a’ richt;
for ye see, Daisy, James is a big laddie noo, an’ he
wants to be a minister, an’ that tak’s a heap o’ siller;
an’ Mary’s gettin’ a big lassie, an’ needin’ music lessons;
for ye ken, Daisy, a’ young folk, espesh’ly a’ young
women folk, should get some music putten into them.
Then there’s Lewie, he’s in Latin a’ready; and Flora,
she’s in the tenpenny book; an’ wee Gordie.—’Deed
he’s no’ that wee, but I like to ca’ him wee when he
disna hear me.—He’s gotten on the kilt, an’ he’ll no’
be lang before he’s upsides wi’ Flora at the schule
[school], for he’s gaun to be a grand scholar. He’s a
feckfu’ [very spirited] laddie, Gordie; he’ll show them
a’ a dance yet. An’ what bothers [troubles] me, Daisy,
is whare’s the siller to come frae? If I could just
hae a quiet crack wi’ the Cornel, I think I could let
him ken hoo he could do a great deal o’ gude wi’ his
siller; for ye ken, Daisy, a’ the auld men that comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
hame frae India for guid an’ a’ bring wi’ them bow-sackfu’s
[large sacks full] o’ siller.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to transcribe intelligently Bell’s conversations
with Daisy—they were conveyed in the
very broadest Scotch. I can only account for this on
the ground that Daisy was not only a patient listener,
and never asked the meaning of any unusual word or
phrase, but that she was also of the very best and
purest Ayrshire breed, and was therefore sure to prefer
the native Doric of the land of Burns.</p>

<p>Bell was sorely tempted to open her mind to Mrs.
Barrie on this subject, but it was the one topic Mrs.
Barrie had strictly enjoined her <i>never</i> to allude to.
During her first year’s service in Mrs. Barrie’s, Bell
had once or twice unwittingly made some references to
it, and these had been the only occasions on which
Mrs. Barrie showed temper towards her. The manifestation
of unutterable abhorrence which these provoked
made Bell so studiously avoid everything that
had the slightest chance of recalling it, that neither in
Mrs. Barrie’s hearing, nor in her conversation with
others, did she ever speak of Dumbarton or her early
association with it; and this may account for Dan’s
astonishment at hearing her refer to the “milking
stone.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>FULL MANY A GEM.</i>”</div>

<p>A strong interest in the Barrie family took hold of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Dan, and although he had few opportunities of showing
it, he hit on one, the most unlikely, considering the
kind of man he was, that could almost be conceived,
but one which went as directly to their hearts as it
did credit to Dan’s.</p>

<p>When Bell paid her early spring visit to Nellie’s
grave, to “sort” it after the winter’s storms, carrying
with her the first bunch of snowdrops, for which she
had watched anxiously, she was surprised to find that
some fresh plants were blooming there already.</p>

<p>She asked Guy if he had done this. He had not.
When she got home she asked all the inmates of
Knowe Park if they had planted them;—they had not.
She ran over in her mind every likely person, and
asked as many as she came into contact with. All
answered, No. It was only after getting Guy to watch
very strictly, for other flowers had been added besides
those she saw first, that she found out that it had
been done by Dan.</p>

<p>Bell was amazed. “O’ a’ the folk in the world, Dan
was the last onybody wad a’ thocht on. Mr. and Mrs.
Barrie could never guess him. There’s mair gude in
the craitur than ever I thocht. I like Dan. Noo
when I think on’t, I’m awfu’ glad that it was Dan.”</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Barrie heard of it, he called at
Dan’s house. This was the first time a minister had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
ever been in it. Dan was a reckless, brave man,
utterly indifferent about religion, and when he saw
Mr. Barrie enter his house he got very uncomfortable—he
felt the power of at least the presence of goodness,
and what conscience he had waxed warm within
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie saw this, and knowing the way to Dan’s
heart, began first to talk of his dog, then of his ferrets,
until Dan felt more at ease, and even offered to give
Mr. Barrie a young bull-dog, which Dan thus described:</p>

<p>“He’s pure bred, an’ the vera picture o’ Burke there;
an’ his mither, auld Nancie that’s noo deid an’ gane,
was the finest o’ her kind in Britain.”</p>

<p>“Then you miss old Nancie, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Miss her! <i>miss her</i>, Mr. Barrie!” said Dan, now
quite at his ease; “I can hardly get ower her death.”</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Mr. Barrie, grasping his horny and by
no means clean hand, “I loved my wee Nellie; and
Mrs. Barrie and all of us thank you.” Here Dan
started and said, “Oh!” but Mr. Barrie still pressed
his hand and spoke on. “Yes, Dan, and we love you
for loving her; and, Dan, wee Nellie would like to
meet you in heaven to thank you herself.”</p>

<p>Here Dan started and said, “Me in heaven, Mr.
Barrie! me in heaven—that’s what she’ll never see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THE OLD, OLD STORY.</i>”</div>

<p>“Why, Dan, why? Nellie’s Saviour wishes you—yes,
<i>you</i>—to get there, and the angels would sing a
loud welcome over you; for as truly as you miss your
Nancie, or we loved Nellie, as certainly as Burke likes
you to make of him, so true is it that our Heavenly
Father wants you to come to Him; just as you are—wild,
careless, sinful, bad as you think your life has
been. There’s a kind friend up there,” said Mr. Barrie,
pointing upwards, “has commanded me to tell you this
good news to-day. Believe it, Dan—believe it.”</p>

<p>Dan was unable to say more than, “Is that a fact?
Sent you to tell me that? I can hardly think that can
possibly be—an’ yet you’re a man o’ your word; but
it’s no’ easy believin’t.”</p>

<p>On the floor of the dirty cottage the two knelt down,
and so simple were Mr. Barrie’s words, and so single
was his heart, that it may safely be said they prayed
together.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie handed Dan half a pound of tobacco,
although he had very great difficulty in persuading
him to accept it; Dan was almost stubborn in his
refusal. Mr. Barrie, however, got him to take it, and
just before leaving kindly advised him to pray for
himself;—“just plain words—only say what you think,
and ask whatever you feel you need, but be sure and
do it at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>Dan said nothing,—it was all strange to him,—but
when Mr. Barrie went away, he thought over it, and
smoked over it, and ultimately resolved to have a crack
with Bell about it, for she could understand him better.
And many a chat they had, but Dan could not be persuaded
to go to the Free Church.</p>

<p>“I micht try the ‘auld kirk,’ it was mair the puir
folk’s kirk, for they tell me that they’re awfu’ folk for

<p class="drop-cap">THE energy of the Free Church had been a subject
of special dislike to Miss Park; and when she
heard that Mr. Barrie called on Dan, and that Bell,
for whom before the Disruption she had a great respect,
was on such intimate terms with him that she actually
allowed him to sit in her kitchen, and even tried to
make a Free Churchman of him, she was exceedingly
bitter in her remarks on the subject.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Walker chanced to call, and she
expatiated to him on the burning shame she felt at
such ongoings.</p>

<p>“The Free Church folks must be hard up for
supporters when they have to go to such a worthless
vagabond and try to make a Christian of him. It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
disgrace, a scandal—it’s sacrilege!” and much to the
same effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker not only did not sympathize with her,
but spoke very firmly to her for thus traducing the
very first principles of Christian charity, and said that
the “plucking of such brands from the burning was
the grandest work the Church could undertake.”</p>

<p>“Then why did <i>you</i> not do it?” said Miss
Park.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker pled guilty to having been remiss in
discharging such duties, but said that he would try to
amend, and that he would see Dan soon.</p>

<p>He told her that it was not an easy matter to meet
every case. “For instance,” said he, “I was calling a
fortnight ago on a man; he said he was in great
distress, both of mind and body, ‘just real ill—just
real, real ill, every way, temporally and spiritually—a’
wrang, body and the ither way; an’ to add to my
troubles, my landlord—the sweep o’er there—has
warned me out o’ his house, for altho’ I aye paid
him his rent, plack an’ farthin’, when I was weel, I’ve
fa’en behind this half-year, an’ I’m just fair despairin’,
just awfu’ bad.’ I advised him to cast all his cares,
of every kind, temporal and spiritual, cares of mind,
cares of body, cares of estate, on his Maker, and ask
His guidance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>IT’S AN ILL WIND.</i>”</div>

<p>“I have just now returned from visiting him, and
to-day I found him in grand spirits, although not, in
my opinion, so much improved in health as to account
for his being so very cheerful. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘how
do you feel to-day?’ ‘Eh, sir!’ said he, ‘yon was
a grand advice ye gied me a fortnight ago, just an
awfu’ grand advice. When you went out I just did
as you told me: I cast a’ my care o’ a’ kinds, baith
for this world an’ the next, a’ my care about mysel’
an’ fam’ly, indeed a’thing, where ye tell’d me;’ and,
he added, with a very hearty voice, jerking his thumb
in the direction of his landlord’s house, ‘eh, man! <i>the
sweep’s deid</i>; he’ll no’ bother me again. So, ye see,
it’s a grand thing to tak’ gude advice; an’ hasna’
Providence been kind, kind?’”</p>

<p>I can recall a visit I paid to a widow shortly after
her husband’s death. He was a well-informed, active,
abstemious man, but had a very violent temper, and
was more easily put into a towering passion than
any man I ever knew. On the slightest provocation,
often on none, he would say the snellest [most biting],
sharpest things. He was a fireside theologian, well
read in the old divines, and an extreme Calvinist, for
he came of a Cameronian stock, and was a Pharisee
of the Pharisees as touching every jot and tittle of
church law and form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>I knew the household well, and whenever I
appeared, Mrs. Gray welcomed me. She was a quiet,
industrious body, and had been to him a good wife
under very difficult circumstances. She had got
through with her work amongst her cows for the
night, but had still on the rough worsted apron of
nappy homespun wool, called a “brat.” She told me
familiarly to take a chair, and sat down herself in an
old high-backed arm-chair, which stood close to the
chimney cheek. There were two or three cushions on
it, highest at the back: it looked an uncomfortable
seat, but it enabled her to rest her feet on the floor,
so that her posture was half leaning backwards and
half sitting. She filled her pipe, for smoking was not
unknown amongst the women-folks round Blinkbonny,
but instead of lighting it by a spunk, she pushed it
into the “ribs” of the kitchen fire, and left it there for
a second or two. Whilst she was preparing for her
favourite “weakness,” I referred to her late husband as
mildly as I could, speaking of his infirmity of temper
as now no more to him, as it really had been a source
of “great tribulation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPEERIT OF MEEKNESS.</i></div>

<p>She withdrew the pipe from the fire, and put it in
her mouth. Some burning sparks were now and again
falling from it on to her brat, but this did not seem to
annoy her, she “dichtit” [wiped] them quietly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
her sloping figure, and said after a few “draws,”
“‘Deed ay, it just shows ye”—here she took a few more
draws in silence—“that the grace o’ God will bide wi’
a man that nae ither body can bide wi’,”—another
silent draw or two,—“for I haena the slichtest doubt
but that Tammas is in heaven;” some strong draws
followed, as the profuse smoke testified,—“<i>but</i> he was
ill to thole [put up with] here. I had my ain adaes
[to do] wi’ him, for he was just a very passionate man;
but ae part o’ the white robe he has on noo will be
the speerit o’ meekness.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An elder in one of the Blinkbonny churches was a
very reserved, silent man, almost afraid to hear the
sound of his own voice. He was an undertaker, and was
on one occasion employed at a funeral. The company
had met, but the minister did not turn up,—a very
unusual thing, for clergymen are most attentive on
such occasions.—(His absence was caused by the
breaking down of a gig when he was on the way.)
The father of the dead child whispered quietly into the
undertaker’s ear:</p>

<p>“Just pit up a prayer yersel’, Mr. Sommerville, if
you please.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” said the worthy man; “no—eh—no—oh,
dinna, dinna ask me; no, I canna!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>After waiting another quarter of an hour, during
which the elder was in a state of great nervous excitement,
the father again came to him, but the elder
beckoned him to come out of the room. When both
were outside, the father said:</p>

<p>“Eh, Mr. Sommerville, the wife, puir bodie, canna
bear to let her wee Tammie be ‘liftit’ without a bit
word o’ prayer; an’ she hasna gotten to the kirk since
Tammie turned badly, an’ she’ll be the better, an
we’ll a’ be the better, o’ a bit prayer. It’s awfu’
heathen-like to tak’ awa’ the bit bairn for gude an’ a’
out o’ it’s mother’s house without a word o’ comfort;
dinna refuse us—we’re a’ kent [known] folk here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sommerville, who was twitching his fingers
until the father had finished, said: “Oh! for ony favour
dinna ask me,—I positeevely cannot do’t in company;”
then taking the father’s hand he pulled him near him,
and said with great earnestness: “I wad rather gi’e
the <i>coffin for naething</i>. Oh! ask the new schoolmaster.”</p>

<p>This was a young teacher who had lately come to
Blinkbonny, and although he was taken aback, he
engaged shortly in prayer. All present were much
pleased, said that he was an uncommonly nice lad,
very obliging, and that anybody could see by his
prayer that “the root o’ the matter was in him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MODEST WORTH.</i></div>

<p>It may seem strange to add that Mr. Sommerville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
was a first-rate elder; he was charitable, considerate,
upright, and helpful to many. His advices were short,
but very “pat:” to the rash, it was, “Leisure a wee;”
to the foolish, “Mend your ways;” to the intemperate,
“Do thyself no harm;” to his apprentices or workmen
when they committed mistakes, his reproofs were not
rebukes, far less reproaches, but, “It’s a pity,” “Ye’ve
gane wrang,” “That’s no’ wiselike;” the most severe
was, “That’s very stupid-like.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tait, the young schoolmaster above referred to,
had succeeded the good old man who had been parish
teacher for nearly half a century. He was selected
from a list of applicants owing to the excellent
testimonials he presented, and had been asked to meet
with the examination committee in Mr. Walker’s
house before the appointment was finally made. He
had acted for some time as assistant in a parish school
adjoining Middlemoor, and was well known to Mr.
Walker. Report said he was “after” a niece of Mr.
Walker’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait on the day of meeting was shown into the
parlour beside Mrs. Walker, the committee being in
the study. He told Mrs. Walker how nervous he was,
and he looked it. She told him not to be afraid—she
would help him through. There was a roast of beef
at the kitchen fire, which she made the servant carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
through the lobby, and slowly past the door of the
study; when the fragrant steam got diffused, she
opened the study door, and said, “Mr. Tait’s here.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION.</i></div>

<p>The other business that had occupied the committee
was very quickly despatched. Mr. Tait was called in,
and Mr. Walker was telling the committee what he
knew of Mr. Tait’s abilities and scholarship, when
Mrs. Walker, after the servant had again carried the
hissing roast through the lobby, half opened the study
door, and gave a nod to Mr. Walker. This, along
with the appeal to the lower nature through the sense
of smell, proved irresistible. The gentleman who had
been deputed to examine the applicant did so with
such haste, and put such childish questions, that everybody
saw it was a joke, for he rattled off questions
and answers as quickly as he could. Mr. Tait never
needed to utter a word.</p>

<p><i>Arithmetic,</i>—said he. <i>Ques.</i> How many are six
and four?—<i>Ans.</i> Ten, to be sure; that will do for
that.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> Who gave the king the most
practical lessons?—<i>Ans.</i> George Buchanan; right
again.</p>

<p><i>Geography.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> What is the largest town in the
world? <i>Ans.</i> Why, Biggar of course—London’s a
big town, but Biggar’s Biggar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p><i>Mathematics.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> What is a simple equation?
<i>Ans.</i> Six and half-a-dozen.</p>

<p><i>Latin.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> What is the Latin for Fish? <i>Ans.</i>
<i>Aqua vitæ</i>, or “Glenlivat.” <i>Ques.</i> Translate <i>Ex nihilo
nihil fit</i>? <i>Ans.</i> It’s time we had something.</p>

<p><i>General Knowledge.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> What’s the best change
for a wearied teacher? <i>Ans.</i> Hill air, for it always
makes him hilarious.</p>

<p><i>Literature.</i>—<i>Ques.</i> What did John Gilpin’s wife say
to him, and what did he reply?</p>

<p class="hanging4">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Ans.</i> “The dinner waits, and we are tired;”</span><br>
&#160;&#160;Says Gilpin, “So am I.”
</p>

<p>The examination was declared satisfactory. Mr.
Tait was appointed schoolmaster of Blinkbonny. The
merry company sought the dining-room, did ample
justice to Mrs. Walker’s hospitality, and drank Mr.
Tait’s good health and great success to him after that
toast had been proposed by Mr. Walker, who, in doing
so, spoke a good deal of Mr. Tait’s uncle, David Tait
of Blackbrae in this parish, who will reappear more
prominently amongst the future “Bits.”</p>

<p>My brother-in-law, the Rev. John Macnab, had
come out with the Free Church, and was assisting
Mr. Barrie at a communion season. The sermon he
preached in the evening was a most carefully prepared
one; his subject was “Heaven;” and as I do not wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
to give an opinion of my relative’s abilities, I may say
that three of the elders said it was “most beautiful,—it
was like a series of dissolving views.” It was a
long sermon, and the descriptive part of it took up so
much time that there was no “application” part
in it.</p>

<p>Old George Brown was, as he had often been on
similar occasions, my guest for the “preachin’s,” as
the services at communion seasons were called; and
in these days they were abundant in number, being
two sermons on Thursday, one on Saturday, and at
least one on Monday, besides from about eleven to
four and an evening service on Sabbath.</p>

<p>When we got home, George astonished Mr. Macnab
by the amount of the day’s services he could repeat;
and when he had given his <i>résumé</i> of the evening
sermon, he finished up with:</p>

<p>“It was really a grand sermon as far as it went.
I never enjoyed a description of heaven better. Ye
told us a’thing aboot heaven except <i>hoo to get there</i>;
and, Maister Macnab, you’ll excuse me, my young
friend, for sayin’ that that shouldna hae been left out,
for ye’ll admit yersel’ if that’s awantin’ a’s awantin’.
Ye’ll mind o’ the king’s son’s feast? The servants didna
only tell that a’thing was ready, but they compelled
them to come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THERE.</i>”</div>

<p>Mr. Macnab said to me that night as we sat together
after every other body had retired: “I’ve been
criticized by learned professors and doctors of divinity,
by ministers of experience and ability, by fellow-students
and relatives, but that good old man has
given me more insight into what preaching should be
than all the others put together; and I hope that as
long as I live I will never, never, when delivering
God’s message to my fellow-men, forget to tell them
‘how to get there.’”</p>

<p>George “got there” before another communion
season came round, and with him were buried many
sayings that were “like apples of gold in pictures of
silver.” Those I have tried to reproduce will remind
many men who are now far on in the journey of life
of the frequent use of Scripture language and metaphor
by the men of two or three generations ago. A tall
man was a “Saul among the people;” news were
carried “from Dan to Beersheba;” a disagreeable
man was “a Mordecai at the gate;” and language
which was in any way approaching profanity,—and the
standard was a rigorous one,—was styled “part in the
speech of Ashdod, and part in the Jews’ language.”
Single names were also used, and to many they were
most expressive, such as an “Achan,” a “Jezebel,”
a “Nathaniel,” a “Goshen,” an “Ishmael.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<p>I have heard a keen politician, during the course of
the election of a member of Parliament (in the days
of open voting, before the “ballot” was introduced,
when the hourly returns of the voting at the various
polling stations were made, and transmitted by swift
riders from one to another), as the numbers were
summed up, ask, in order to know the state of the
poll, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” I have
also heard a very worthy elder say in the presence of
a very worthy minister, “Mary, bring out Jeroboam.”
Mary produced the whisky bottle. My teetotal friends
will doubtless think this a most appropriate name.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Barrie had been so pleased with Dan’s attention
to Nellie’s grave, that she laid aside the first suit
of clothes Mr. Barrie cast off (I may as well tell that
Bell and she between them had “turned” them), and
she was debating with herself whether to go to his
house with them, or send for him, when she met him
at the manse gate. With considerable difficulty she
prevailed on him to come up to the house, but could
not induce him to come on to the front approach,
much less in by the front door.</p>

<p>“I’ll stand here, if you please, mem,” said Dan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WEIGHT OF HONOURS.</i></div>

<p>“But I wish to speak with you in the house, Mr.
Corbett, if you please,” said Mrs. Barrie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Dan grinned from ear to ear at “<i>Mr.</i>” Corbett; he
did not remember of ever having been called that
before, and he kept repeating, “Maister,—Maister, if
you please—Eh, Dan, ye’ll dae now,” laughing
heartily either to or at himself. Dan seldom laughed—it
was almost a new sensation to him; but the “Maister,
if you please,” tickled him immensely, and by the
time Bell had got the kitchen door open, for she saw
him halt before the window, and slap his leg, and
laugh until even the blind eye opened and yielded
copious tears (so she said), he was in a social, happy
glow.</p>

<p>“What’s ta’en ye the day, Dan? what grand news
hae ye gotten? have ye seen the Cornel?”</p>

<p>Dan could not reply, but brushed past Bell, and
said when he settled a little:</p>

<p>“It’s naething at a’, Bell—it’s fair silliness o’ me;
but Mrs. Barrie met me at the road end and said,”
here he fell a-laughing again,—“‘Maister Corbett, if
you please.’ I’m no’ used wi’ such genty manners, an’
like mony anither fule I was laughin’ at mysel’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie came into the kitchen, and he laughed
when she again called him “Mr. Corbett,” and said:
“Ca’ me Dan, if you please, mem; naebody ever ca’d
me Maister a’ my days afore, and it sounds very
droll—<i>Maisterin’</i> me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Daniel, then!” said Mrs. Barrie.</p>

<p>“Dan, if you please, mem—just plain Dan.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s liker the thing,” said he.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Barrie spoke very nicely to him; her
silver tones touched his ear like music, and her words
reached his heart as she thanked him for what he
had so beautifully done at wee Nellie’s grave; and she
prevailed on him to come into the dining-room to see
a miniature of her Nellie that a friend had painted
from memory, and presented to her. There were other
pictures on the walls, mostly engravings, which Mrs.
Barrie explained so neatly, and with so much animation
and clearness, that Dan forgot himself in listening
to her, and when she had gone round the room he
asked:</p>

<p>“What did ye say about this ane, if you please,
mem? I think ye called it the Angel’s Whisper?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>MINISTERING ANGELS.</i>”</div>

<p>When she re-described it, he asked about another
and another. All the engravings were on suggestive
subjects, and Mrs. Barrie made them doubly
interesting by her explanations; and almost unconsciously
to herself, she kept dropping into his weary
heart simple loving words of truth and peace as poor
Dan turned from one picture to another, and Mrs.
Barrie followed up her description with increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
interest to herself as well as to Dan. She also gave
him the clothes, and very sweetly counselled him to
go to the church, any church he liked, and he would
hear some fine pictures.</p>

<p>“There’s nane in the Blinkbonny kirks that I ever
heard o’, unless it be yon marble image on young
Captain M<sup>c</sup>Lellan’s headstane at the side o’ the auld
kirk pulpit; an’ I aye said to Guy’s gude-faither, auld
Ritchie, that it was daftlike to hae guns and bayonets
an’ swords stuck up like stooky [stucco] images in a
kirk. But I dinna ken what to do wi’ thae fine claes
[clothes]; they’re no’ the least like me.”</p>

<p>Dan, however, accepted them at length with a very
proper bow, if lowness is any criterion, took another
look of Nellie’s miniature, and made several bows to
Mrs. Barrie as he left the dining-room.</p>

<p>His description of the pictures gave Bell great
delight, and she dropped in a useful word or hint
now and again as he went on. Dan ended with:</p>

<p>“Bell, yon picture o’ wee Nellie let’s me ken her
noo, an’ I will keep her grave snod; an’ there’s yon
ane about the angel’s whisper, an’ anither ane I maun
ask ye to let me see again some day. D’ye ken if
Mrs. Barrie wad haud [hold] the kirk in the dinin’-room,
an’ gang o’er yon pictures, she wad beat a’ the ministers
ever I heard” (“No very mony, after a’,” thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Dan to himself, “mair’s the pity”). “What for do they
no’ hae pictures in the kirk, an’ tell ye’ about them,
like Mrs. Barrie? I think they wad soon fill their
kirks if they did that.”</p>

<p>Dan tried on the clothes as soon as he got home,
and he scarcely knew himself. His first remark was,
“Guy, mind yersel’, or I’ll rin ye hard for the beadleship!”
His next, looking at his hands, “They’s no
like thae claes.” He then took down his fishing-rod,
took his towel with him (it was a ragged old potato bag),
bought a bit of soap as he passed through the village,
sought out a quiet pool, and made himself as clean as
soap, water, and a rough towel could make him.
After this was over, “Ah, but I’m the better o’ that;
I’ll do’t oftener,” said he, and put up his fishing-rod.
The best of the fish he caught were put under
Knowe Park “bass” as formerly, long after night had
fairly settled down. Dan started next day to clean
his house. Some corners needed it very badly. He did
the cleaning very well considering.</p>

<p>He had a strange dream the night after he had
seen the pictures, and after thinking over it and
wondering about it for nearly a week, he was driven
to tell it to Bell for peace’ sake, as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GATES AJAR.</i></div>

<p>“I thocht I was in heaven, an’ about the first body
I met was wee Nellie. I didna ken her at first, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
she kent me, an’ she was that glad to see me; an’
somehow I wasna the least feared. An’ she asked
me if I would come an’ see her mansion, an’ she
took me into a beautiful room, an’—but I couldna
lay’d off till ye, so I’ll no try’t—an’ I asked her
wha gied her’t, an’ I never saw onything as bonnie
as her face, or heard onything as sweet as her voice,
as she said, ‘Jesus! O Dan, come away an’ see Him!’
‘No,’ said I, ‘Nellie; He’s no’ for the like o’ me.’
If ye had seen her face when she said, ‘But He is,
Dan, He is; He likes you better than a’ the gold
in a’ the world.’ Then she said, ‘I’ll let ye see
mamma’s mansion.’ It was as bonnie as Nellie’s, but
it was a’ hung round wi’ pictures, an’ Mrs. Barrie was
in them a’, an’ aye some ither wi’ her—whiles ane,
Nellie, or maybe Mr. Barrie, an’ whiles folk I ken,
besides folk I dinna ken; but she was aye in the
middle o’ the picture. An’ there was ane wi’ mysel’ an’
her in’t, an’ it was something like the ‘Angel’s Whisper,’—but
the angels were awfu’ like her tae.</p>

<p>“An’ Nellie showed me your mansion, Bell, an’ it was
braw, an’ fu’ o’ bonnie pictures just like Mrs. Barrie’s;
an’ I was in some o’ them tae. An’ I noticed that ye
had on your everyday working claes—your very commonest,
and hardly ever on your Sabbath claes at a’.</p>

<p>“Weel, Nellie said to me, ‘Come an’ see your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
mansion, Dan.’ I was kind o’ terrified, but she could
mak’ me do anything she likit. Weel, we went to
what she ca’d my mansion, an’ the pictures round it
were fearsome to look at, an’ I was in the middle o’
every ane; an’ there was ane where there were angels
very like Mrs. Barrie, an’ Mr. Barrie, an’ you, speaking
to me, an’ lookin’ at me, an’ pointin’ up,—an’ I lookit
up.</p>

<p>“I was sae much ta’en up wi’ the pictures, I didna
notice that Nellie had gaen out; but when I saw Mrs.
Barrie an’ you pointin’ up in the picture, I lookit up,
an’ in a moment Nellie comes in an’ says, ‘Here’s
Jesus;’ an’ all at once the pictures vanished, an’ the
walls were as clean an’ white as the driven snaw, an’
there was only one picture left, an’ that was Jesus.
An’ somehow He didna fear me till He cam’ out o’ the
picture an’ showed me His hands, an’ there were marks
in the very middle o’ them, like as if nails had once
been driven through them; an’ he was gaun to lay His
hands on me when I wakened;—and it’s been in my
head ever since, but I didna like to tell aboot it. D’ye
think it means that I shouldna wear yon fine claes?
or what d’ye think?”</p>

<p>Need I say that Bell was greatly struck with the
dream, and did what she could to press home the
lesson it so clearly taught? But Dan said, “Oh, but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Bell, mind He didna lay hands on me; but that was
maybe my blame, for I started back. But I’m glad
I’ve tell’t you, an’ ye can tell Mrs. Barrie if you like.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND.</i></div>

<p>Bell did so. And although Dan was not much
changed outwardly, he liked to speak to Bell about
good things, and gave over sundry bad habits, and
went to Mr. Walker’s kirk; although, poor man, he
knew so little about the service, that when Mr. Walker
said at the end of his sermon, “I will conclude by,”
Dan set off, supposing that all would follow very soon,
and he was astonished to find that the folk took so
long to come home from the church that day. Generally
his wonder had been, “Are they oot a’ready?”
as Sunday forenoon had been a great day for Watty
and his cronies meeting in Dan’s house and garden for
a crack on bull-dogs, game-cocks, and sporting matters.
But they paid this respect to religion, that they did
not start for Dan’s until the church was “in,” and left
so as to be home before the church was out.</p>

<p>Dan gave up keeping game fowls, but stuck to his
other favourites, and became a quieter man; but I will
not enter further into his state of mind than say that,
I believe he attended the parish church, and I was
told that some time after the dream, but I cannot say
as to the precise date, he tried to put himself in the
way of Mr. Scott of Babbie’s Mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Scott stared to see Dan, and spoke rudely to
him. Dan waited till he was done, and then said,
“Mr. Scott, there’s a slap in your hedge, an’ the
sheep’s among the corn. I’ve driven them out, and
stappit [pushed] in a bush, but if ye’ve ony stabs or
palings I’ll mend it for ye in a crack.”</p>

<p>“I want nane o’ yer mendings.”</p>

<p>“Aweel,” said Dan, “I see ye’re angry; and I can
only say, Mr. Scott, if ye’ll no’ be friends, dinna blame
me. I own I spoke sair till ye, but was you no’ first
in the fault? I’m no’ seeking onything frae ye, but
as I’m an auld man I want to die in peace wi’ my
neibours, so I ax yer pardon, and gude day.”</p>

<p>“Die in peace!—ye’ll die in a jail, or no’ unlikely
on a gallows!” said the miller.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Dan, “but Mr. Walker was tellin’
us on Sabbath about a deein’ thief, an’ he was made a’
richt as he was deein’; an’ maybe Him that helpit him
will help me.”</p>

<p>“Dan,” said the miller in astonishment, “are you
gaun to the kirk noo?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Dan,—“whiles.”</p>

<p>“Weel, Dan, ye seem to make a better use o’ the
kirk than I dae; and as ye was saying, we’ll let byganes
be byganes. And thank ye about the sheep.”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>THE PIPE OF PEACE.</i></div>

<p>“Aweel,” replied Dan, “Mr. Walker whiles speaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
about lost sheep, and I thocht as I saw yours amang
the corn, that the sooner our slaps [gaps] are filled up
the better for ourselves and for the sheep, for some o’
them seemed <i>swalled</i> [swollen].”</p>

<p>The miller and Dan started with the requisites,
mended the slap, looked at the sheep, smoked a quiet
pipe, and parted.</p>

<p>“That cowes [beats] a’,” said the miller.</p>

<p>“The canny way’s the best way, after a’,” said Dan.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon was spending part of the summer
with Mr. Kirkwood, and they called at Knowe Park.
The Colonel’s relationship to Mrs. Barrie was clearly
established; and a piano, and some other marks of kindness
on the Colonel’s part, were sent from Edinburgh
shortly thereafter. But unfortunately Bell was not in
when the gentlemen called, greatly to Mr. Kirkwood’s
regret, and their visit had been a short one.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon was in indifferent health, and Mr.
Kirkwood would not allow him to exert or excite himself
in any way, so that Bell’s “castle in the air” was
as hazy as ever; and as neither Mr. nor Mrs. Barrie had
thought much on the matter, the presents were taken as
tokens of goodwill, and politely acknowledged as such,
but they formed no ground in their minds of any, far
less of such great expectations as they did in Bell’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>The social element in religion was greatly promoted
by the soirees and meetings of that nature held in connection
with the Free Church. Mr. Barrie used to tell
of Mr. Taylor’s usual welcome when he dropped in of an
evening: “Come away, Mr. Barrie, ye’ll spend an hour
wi’ us. There’s a great deal o’ religion in sociality, an’
there’s far ower little sociality in our religion—for
that’s what I think is the ‘communion of saints,’ it’s
just sociality—gude neibourship, as far as our firesides
are concerned.”</p>

<p>At one of our soirees—I think it was in 1850—Sir
John M<sup>c</sup>Lelland suddenly appeared in the Free
Church lobby. Dr. Guthrie was one of the speakers,
and the church was crammed. Some young men
acted as ticket-collectors and stewards at the door,
and they had been so anxious to lose nothing of
the speeches, that they did not even look round in
reply to Sir John’s question, “Could you find room
for me?”</p>

<p>“Have you a ticket?” was the reply.</p>

<p>“A ticket! What sort of ticket? I’ve no ticket,”
said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Weel, there are no bags left, and there’s no room
in the church, so you cannot get in.”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.</i></div>

<p>This was said without the speaker’s even turning
round to see to whom he was speaking. Luckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
one of the deacons observed Sir John, who said to him,
“Can I not get in? This young man here spoke
to me about some bag and ticket, and said I could
not get in.”</p>

<p>“Stupid fellow!—beg pardon!—please come this
way,” was the reply.</p>

<p>When the poor steward looked round he was so
utterly ashamed of himself that he stood speechless.
He “catch’t it” from the other stewards, and his
evening’s enjoyment was spoiled.</p>

<p>Sir John was shown into the vestry, and when the
speaker for the time had concluded, he came to the
platform.</p>

<p>The surprise at his appearance added to the warmness
of his reception. It seemed as if the audience
could not cease their expressions of delight. When
silence was restored, Mr. Barrie announced Dr. Guthrie
as the next speaker.</p>

<p>Sir John instantly rose and asked to be allowed to
say a few words. He first told the story of the
children and Dr. Guthrie at the post-office, which
made Kennedy the tailor spring first on to the seat,
then stand astride on two seats, and wave his Turkey-red
and white spotted cotton handkerchief so excitedly,
and cheer so loudly, that he had to be taken down
almost by force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>After Kennedy was quiet, Sir John said, “I spoke
to Mr. Barrie and several of this audience at the time
of the Disruption in a way that I now regret. My
language was unguarded and unwise. I do not state
my present opinions; but I then made publicly some
very strong statements which I now wish as publicly
to withdraw. Mr. Barrie, and hundreds of ministers
besides him, acted like truly Christian heroes, and
carried out their conscientious convictions in most
difficult and trying circumstances. I honour them for
it. But,” turning to the audience, “I honour you, and
those who form the membership of the Free Church of
Scotland, for the noble, and liberal, and high-toned
manner in which you have recognised this heroism,
and carried forward so triumphantly the cause for
which they contended. The Free Church is in my
opinion, in Scotland, <span class="allsmcap">THE</span> <i>event</i> of the century, and I
can hardly conceive that a more noble testimony to
principle could have been possible in any other country
in the world.”</p>

<p>Then turning to Dr. Guthrie, he asked to be excused
for almost interrupting him; and to the audience for
trespassing on their patience when such a speaker as
Dr. Guthrie was to follow him.</p>

<p>Dr. Guthrie shook hands long and warmly with Sir
John, and they had plenty of time; and when Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
Guthrie did speak, it was with a “forty parson”
power. He excelled himself, enchained his audience,
and that soiree is a “red-letter” day in Blinkbonny
Free Church annals.</p>

<p>Bell said it was “awfu’ splendid,”—“just magnificent,”—“it
beat everything,”—“she just couldna
say what it wasna,—it was ‘maist awfu’, awfu’
splendid!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Blinkbonny Free Church congregation was
now a strong one,—so strong that a Dorcas
Society was added to its other schemes, and proved
of great service to the members as well as to the
poor. The choice of Mrs. Clark as convener was a
happy one. She became the mainspring of the concern;
and faithfully did she inquire into all needful
cases, and considerately did she administer the funds,—in
some instances so quietly, that several compared
the help they received to “Peter’s sheet that was let
down from heaven;” and in not a few cases the assistance
was all the more welcome because, although it
was greatly needed, it would only have been asked as
a last resort.</p>

<p>The collectors had some difficulty in getting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Dorcas Society started. One of them—a Miss Roxburgh—asked
a subscription for this purpose from
Mr. Skinner, a well-to-do and successful man.</p>

<p>“A what kind of society do you call it,—a Dorcas
Society? What in all the world’s that?” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s to provide clothing and coals for the poor.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you not call it something else than
that foreign name Dorcas? Is it Latin, or French, or
what is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Miss Roxburgh, “it’s called after Dorcas,
the woman that made garments for the poor. You’ll
remember of her,—Tabitha or Dorcas?”</p>

<p>“Not I. I never even heard of her name before,—Tabby
or Dorcas, or whatever you call her. Where
did you fall in with her? I am certain it was not in
the Bible,” said Mr. Skinner firmly.</p>

<p>“Hoots, ye’re forgetting,” said Miss Roxburgh.
“It’s in the Acts of the Apostles. We read that she
died, and they sent for Peter; and when the poor
widows showed him the clothes she had made for
them, he prayed, and she was brought to life again.”</p>

<p>“I read the Bible as well as you,” replied Mr.
Skinner, “and I never either heard or read of any
such woman. It’s not in the Acts, I’m certain.
However, as the object is a good one, there’s a pound
to you; but for any favour give your society a decent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
name, for nobody will understand what Dorcas means.
Dorcas! there is not such a person in all the Bible.”</p>

<p>After the first year the society ceased to be a Free
Church scheme and became a village one; but Mrs.
Clark was continued at the head of it. She made it
a matter of conscience,—stuck to the principle of
helping nobody that had others—especially a “man”—that
could work for them. The distribution of coals
was to her a matter of first concern in the early
winter; and, like Job, she could say, “The cause
which I knew not I searched out,” until the receivers
came to speak of them as “Mrs. Clark’s coals.” I
commend this “bit” to what an old elder used to
call “my female brethren,” and am convinced if they
go and do likewise they will in no wise lose their
reward.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie had some trouble over what was known
as the “Morisonian” controversy. I will not enter
on the question itself. It turned on the decrees of
election, predestination, and what are known as the
Calvinistic doctrines.</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>FOOLS RUSH IN.</i>”</div>

<p>George Hunter, a weaver, who had imbibed the
Morisonian ideas, had a considerable power of putting
the knotty points in a light which made the Calvinistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
theory appear very monstrous, and he thought he
could easily corner Mr. Barrie. George at length got
what he had anxiously longed for, viz. a chance to
fire off the cleverly worded sentences he had elaborated
on the subject. Mr. Barrie, in reply, quietly stated
the doctrine as given in the <i>Confession of Faith</i>, and
quoted the Apostle Paul as his authority.</p>

<p>“But that’s where me an’ Paul differs,” said George.</p>

<p>“What!” said Mr. Barrie, “that’s where Paul and
you differ? Do you not consider the Apostle Paul as
an absolute and indisputable authority?”</p>

<p>“Weel,” said George, “hardly; for I believe that
Paul was wrang when he said that.”</p>

<p>“Paul wrong!” said Mr. Barrie. “Your faith in
yourself is certainly great, but you will excuse me
for preferring Paul’s authority not only before yours,
but to the exclusion of all others,” and thus closed
the interview.</p>

<p>In the early summer of 1851, Colonel Gordon again
came to reside with Mr. Kirkwood, near Blinkbonny;
and although still an invalid, he was stronger and
more cheerful. He had brought with him an invalid’s
chair, on which he could be wheeled about, and Dan
was employed to push it. When Colonel Gordon first
saw Dan he took a long, inquiring look at him, as if
the face was not altogether an unknown one; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
said nothing, as he thought it likely that he must
have seen him when in Blinkbonny last year. Knowe
Park became the Colonel’s favourite destination in his
airings. This may have been at first brought about
by a little management on Dan’s part; but the old
soldier soon grew so fond of the children, that every
day when the weather admitted of his getting out, he
landed there.</p>

<p>Bell liked the Colonel for his own sake. He was a
fine type of the old Indian military man,—courteous,
interesting, and still handsome despite his advanced
years. Generally she had some tasty soup or other
slight refreshment ready for him, which he thoroughly
enjoyed; and he told Mrs. Barrie that her cook did
more to make him well than the doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood often referred to Bell’s potato-soup
in terms which the Colonel thought absurdly high.
On one of his visits, little Gordie asked him if he
would like to see the new chickens. The boy’s
beaming face interested him, and he said,</p>

<p>“Certainly; will you take me to see them?”</p>

<p>Gordie, trained as he had been by Bell not to disturb
her feathered friends, said timidly, “I think Bell would
let you see them, but she’ll not let me touch them.”</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>KIND ECHOES.</i></div>

<p>Bell was only too glad. Dan wheeled the Colonel
to the spot near the outhouses where the “birdies”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
were. It was some time before he could so far relax
his old Indian notions about servants as to speak <i>to</i>
Bell; but she was so attentive and so respectful that
he gradually got into familiar conversation with her,
and even referred to Mr. Kirkwood’s constant praise of
her potato-soup.</p>

<p>Bell, whilst keeping her proper distance, so thoroughly
won his respect that he thanked her for the
kind way in which she had studied to have something
tasty for him, and complimented her on her cookery.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to do all in my power for Mrs. Barrie’s
friend,” said Bell, “for she’s been a kind mistress to
me; an’ although no’ rich in one respec’, she has the
best o’ a’ kind o’ riches, for she has a’ Martha’s
briskness an’ a’ Mary’s meekness. As to the pitattie-soup,
it was just what was gaun that day; but if
Maister Kirkwood wad—as he’s sae fond o’ Scotch
dishes—come here till his dinner some day, Mr. and
Mrs. Barrie wad be glad to see him wi’ you, sir,—but
dinna say I said it,—and I wad try to let him taste
some o’ the things he spoke o’ the first day he was
here.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Kirkwood would be delighted, I know: he
often speaks about these things,—offener than I care
about, for when he begins there’s no stopping of him,”
said the Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, beggin’ your pardon for bein’ sae presumin’,”
said Bell, “if ye’ll tell me what he likes best,
if it’s a plain auld Scotch dish, I’ll try to mak’ it sae
that it’ll at least bring Mr. Kirkwood in mind, as he
says, o’ auld langsyne; for a’ our denners here are
auld-fashioned hamely fare.”</p>

<p>“Really I could not choose for him. What do you
think would be suitable yourself? For I begin to
relish the idea of seeing him sit down to a really
Scotch dinner,—he so often speaks of it. It would
be quite a treat to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bell thoughtfully, “let me see,—he’s
tried our potato-soup, but there’s ‘cockie-leekie,’ an’
green pea soup, an’ ‘hotch-potch;’ and for after that
a haggis an’ collops, or a singed sheep’s head; an’
after that pancakes, an’ rhubarb wi’ some o’ Daisy’s
cream.”</p>

<p>Here Bell was interrupted and almost startled by
Mr. Kirkwood’s appearance and voice. He had come
to call, but seeing the gathering at the outhouses, he
walked very quietly forward and had overheard Bell’s
last sentence.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>THE COMMISSARIAT.</i></div>

<p>“Cockie-leekie!” said he; “splendid! Sheep’s
head broth!—glorious! I had forgotten it. Haggis
and pancakes!—magnificent! Collops, and what more
did you say?” Then turning to Colonel Gordon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
“You laughed at me for praising the potato-soup, and
here you are getting a whole catalogue of dishes. I
can only say that you’re vastly better lately if you are
the length of dining on such fare.”</p>

<p>“It was for you, Mr. Kirkwood, that I was catering,
not for myself,” replied the Colonel; “and we must
see Mrs. Barrie about the matter first.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood found occasion, on their way to the
house, twice or thrice to turn round and speak to
Bell (who followed at a respectful distance) about
some old-fashioned dishes, until Colonel Gordon
said:</p>

<p>“Really, Kirkwood, don’t bother my good friend
with such questions. You speak as if your fortune
depended on them. Don’t make so much of your
lower nature.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that so much as old associations,” said
Mr. Kirkwood; “but if you had come into a house
on a cold day and got the potato-soup that I”—</p>

<p>“Stop, Kirkwood, please! Do stop,—I’ve heard it
fifty times,” replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>When the gentlemen got into the dining-room, they
felt at a loss how to invite <i>themselves</i>; but Gordie, on
whose shoulder Colonel Gordon steadied himself when
entering the house, did it for them by saying:</p>

<p>“Mamma, Mr. Kirkwood’s coming here to dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
some day, and Bell is going to make pancakes and
nice, nice things for <i>us all</i>.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be delighted to see you, gentlemen,” said
Mrs. Barrie, with a very slight bow to each, “any day
that will be most convenient.” Tuesday week was
fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood brought with him some champagne
of a special vintage, it being the only stimulant
Colonel Gordon was allowed to take, and sent it
quietly by Dan to Bell. She, busy with her own
special work, looked at the bottles, and as she had
not had champagne in hand before, she said to
Dan:</p>

<p>“Take that gold off the cork an’ that string, an’
I’ll draw’t, an’ pit it into a crystal bottle to be
ready.”</p>

<p>Alas! the cork flew into Bell’s face, half the wine
was spilt, and she said sharply:</p>

<p>“Let them draw the next that likes, I’ll no’ fash
wi’t.” Thereafter Mr. Kirkwood became his own
butler for the day.</p>

<p>He was <i>carried away</i> by the cockie-leekie to
which, at his own request, he was helped three times.
Everything else, especially the pancakes, increased his
delight. The others around the table enjoyed his
immense satisfaction as much as they did the dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
which, at least in Gordie’s case, is saying a very great
deal.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>THE CORRIDORS OF TIME.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood walked alongside of Colonel Gordon’s
chair as they went homewards,—Dan, of course,
acting as propeller. When they had reached a high
part of the road, they halted to enjoy the scene and
the cool evening air. Colonel Gordon looked at Dan,
who was wiping his brow, and observing a scar on
his temples, he said:</p>

<p>“I’ve surely seen you long ago; it’s like a dream
to me, but was it not you that brought me a letter
from my brother, many, many years since, when I was
sailing for India? You had a patch over your brow,
and you told me you had had your eye hurt.”</p>

<p>Dan started and said: “Please, sir, are you a brother
of the Duke o’ Gordon’s,—toots, I beg your pardon,—Kenneth
Gordon’s?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said the Colonel. “I see now it was you
that brought the letter. I was sure I knew you.
Poor Kenneth, he was a daring fellow. Did you
know him well?”</p>

<p>“I was one o’ his oarsmen,” said Dan, “but I haena
seen him since the day he gied me the letter to
gi’e to you—that was the day after he hid the brandy
an’ the tobacco in Mr. Gordon o’ the Granaries’
cellar, thinkin’ he could get it out next nicht; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the gaugers got scent o’t, and it took us a’ oor time to
get off frae Dumbarton. It was then that I lost my
e’e.”</p>

<p>“Brandy!—tobacco!—excisemen after him!” said
Colonel Gordon, evidently under great excitement
“Gordon of the Granaries’ cellar!—are you in earnest?
I’m perfectly stunned. On your life, tell me everything
you know about this matter.”</p>

<p>Dan did so, and pulling from the inside of his vest
an old pocket-book, he showed a bit of dingy paper
with some hieroglyphics on it that none but the
initiated could decipher.</p>

<p>“Ye understand, sir, the smugglers that I rowed
the boat for had lots o’ hidin’-places for their stuff, an’
this was one o’ the books they keepit. There, now,—that
anchor wi’ the five twists o’ rope round it, means
five kegs o’ brandy; that R K inside o’ the rope,
means Roseneath kirkyard; that’s your brither’s mark,
B Y D and a drawing o’ a ‘boyn’ or tub,—it was
something about the Duke o’ Gordon in the north
country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Colonel quickly, “Bydand is part
of the Gordon crest, and Aboyne their castle;—but go
on.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>STRANGER THAN FICTION.</i>”</div>

<p>“Weel, here’s for Gordon o’ the Granaries;—a castle,
that’s Dumbarton;—a granary wi’ a G, that’s Gordon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
place; an’ there’s the anchor wi’ five twists, an’ twa
tobacco-pipes made like a five; and there’s the duke’s
mark. An’ that mark’s,—beggin’ your pardon, Mr.
Kirkwood,—Ma’colm Kirkwood’s;—it’s a comb, an’ a
kirk, an’—an’—” Here Dan was interrupted by Mr.
Kirkwood saying warmly:</p>

<p>“A gallows-tree, a wood or ‘wuddie,’ sure enough,
for hanging smugglers on. Both the entries and
signatures are very suggestive.”</p>

<p>“An’,” continued Dan, “that mark o’ the half-moon
on legs wi’ the wings on’t, means that the vera
nicht ony o’ the ither companies o’ the gang sees’t,
they’re to get the stuff awa’ to some ither place
immediately, that’s markit on the paper, <i>if</i> there’s twa
marks o’ the heid men on’t, like what this has, but no’
unless. An’ I got the book frae your brither, to tak’ to
anither party o’ the smugglers when the hue and cry
about the thing blew past. For your brither, sir, never
thocht the gaugers wad find out the stuff in the
granaries; but they fand it, an’ puir Mr. Gordon had
to pay the fine, an’ it ruined him; an’ nobody kens till
this day whae put it there, except mysel’—at least that
I ken o’. I left the smugglers for gude an’ a’ after
that.”</p>

<p>Dan’s story, corroborated as it was by the outlandish
book of entries, completely unhinged both gentlemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
From Mr. Kirkwood’s manner, one would have guessed
that the Malcolm Kirkwood had been a relative of
his; but of that I can say nothing. With Colonel
Gordon it was otherwise. When they reached home
they got all out of Dan they could, and more than they
relished, for his brother’s connection with smuggling
was new to the Colonel.</p>

<p>A painful scene took place at Knowe Park next day,
when Mrs. Barrie told of her father’s trial at the law,
the fine, and how it not only drained his purse, but
broke his heart.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon now understood why his brother
had written to him so urgently from his dying-bed to
be kind to the Gordons of the Granaries, if ever he had
the opportunity. He did all that he now could do to
atone for the grievous wrong his brother had done to
her father, by handing over at once a considerable
portion of his means to the family at Knowe Park.</p>

<p>The Colonel died a few years after this, and in his
will, all that he was possessed of was bequeathed to
Mrs. Barrie and her family, burdened with an annuity
of fifty pounds a year to Daniel Corbett, and some
trifling legacies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT?</i>”</div>

<p>From the day that Dan had told the smuggling
adventure, Colonel Gordon had been kind to him, and
every now and again the banker sent a request to Dan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
to call at the bank for money. Not even going to
church put Dan more about than going to the bank;
the stanchels of the windows kept his solitary eye
busy, and as soon as he put his cross to the receipt,
he slunk out, and took a by-road home.</p>

<p>Where to put the money exercised his mind sadly.
He thought everybody knew he had it. At length he
put it under one of the rough flags of the floor, where
“Burke” lay, wrapping it well with old paper, and
stuffing it thereafter into an old game-bag. The
money contributed little to his personal comfort, but
he occasionally helped his poorer neighbours. Bell
tried to get something for the missionary cause.
His answer was barely civil: “Send siller to the
niggers! no’ very likely!” Dan’s nature was a secretive
one; few could make anything of him, none much to
boast of, for on all emotional subjects he was “cabined,
cribbed, confined.”</p>

<p>The Free Church of Blinkbonny heard with mingled
feelings, chiefly, I must confess, composed of deep
regret, that the “Wishart” church in Edinburgh had
resolved to call Mr. Barrie to be their pastor. Many
of us knew that he was highly appreciated in places
where he occasionally preached, and that his appearances
in the synods and assemblies had brought him
into favourable notice; and although we had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
gratified to hear strangers express themselves as
astonished that he should be allowed to remain in
Blinkbonny, the idea of his really leaving us was
never seriously entertained.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon’s unexpected gift had added very
materially to Mr. Barrie’s comfort, in as far as it enabled
him to do more for the education of his children than
the “equal dividend” of the Free Church alone could
admit of; and he had tried to prevent a call from
coming out in his favour.</p>

<p>He was, however, overborne by the urgent solicitations,
not only of the Wishart congregation, but even
more so by fathers and brethren in the ministry, who
pressed him very closely to accept of the call to Edinburgh.
Mrs. Barrie, on whose judgment he relied
more implicitly than on all others put together, declined
to express any opinion on this subject. She
was pleased to see that her husband’s gifts were
appreciated, and felt that benefits to the Church, as
well as to her family, were likely to result from his
going to Edinburgh. But she liked Blinkbonny, and
she had heard of the heavy calls and frequent worries
of a city charge; and as she could not make up her
mind which <i>she</i> would prefer, she remained neutral,
although not at all taciturn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRO AND CON.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Barrie and she talked the matter fully over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
looking at it on all sides, and she entered patiently
and minutely into all the pros and cons, sometimes
considerably to his confusion. For whilst she gave a
comprehensive statement of the arguments for going
and staying, she did this so evenly that it merely
assisted his judgment, but it did not at all influence
his decision.</p>

<p>About this time the “Ecclesiastical Titles Bill” was
absorbing public attention, and the Churches in Scotland
entered on a feverish crusade against the Church
of Rome. The deputation which appeared at the
presbytery to prosecute the call to Mr. Barrie dwelt
largely on this subject. I have already referred to
Mr. Barrie’s deeply-rooted aversion to a matter of this
kind. On this occasion he spoke out very strongly,
much to the surprise, if not to the dissatisfaction, of
the Edinburgh representatives.</p>

<p>He declared it was his conviction that spasmodic
agitation of this kind was of no practical use. It
oftener resulted in harm than good. There was much
in the Romish Church which he disliked and condemned,
but there was also much that he respected,—its
zeal, its energy, its stand for liberty and learning
in the Dark Ages, and its success in reaching the very
poorest and keeping hold of them. Rank injustice
was often done by ignorant tirade, or exaggerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
misrepresentation of certain tenets. To enter into either
an explanation or a refutation, or, worse still, a denunciation
of Mariolatry, Transubstantiation, etc., to a
Protestant audience was unedifying, to say the least of
it. If the fiery zeal directed against Popery were
applied to preaching and living the gospel, it would
be better for the minister, the people, and the world;
and unless he greatly changed his mind, he would not
meet the wishes of the deputation in that matter. He,
however, reserved his decision till next meeting of
presbytery.</p>

<p>One reverend Edinburgh brother was present, on
whom the no-Popery cry had taken an excessively
firm hold; it was the only subject which warmed him
up at all, but it made him furious, and formed part of
every discourse he preached, until many of his hearers
said, “they couldna sleep in the kirk noo;” and one
of his elders affirmed that “he was aye pop-pop-poperyin’
away; if he pop-poperied mickle mair, I’ll
no’ pop back to hear him.”</p>

<p>This deputy tried to reply to Mr. Barrie, but Mr.
Taylor said “it was like a Dandie Dinmont laying
about him wi’ a flail on thrashed straw—plenty o’
exercise an’ stour, but nae wark dune; muckle cry an’
little woo’ [wool], as the,” etc. At next meeting of
presbytery Mr. Barrie accepted the call to Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>COMING EVENTS CAST.</i>”</div>

<p>In contemplating the Edinburgh call, it is possible
to conceive that Bell might have been one of Mrs.
Barrie’s difficulties, for life in a town would not suit
her at all. What would she do without Daisy? for
so all her cows were named, prefixed in order to distinguish
them by the colour of each, so that Bell had
had during her stay in Blinkbonny a brown Daisy, a
black Daisy, etc., and now she had a ginger Daisy.
Could she do without the garden, and especially the
hens? No.</p>

<p>But Bell had been rather a thought to Mrs. Barrie
for some time past. Not that she had failed or flagged—she
was as “eident” [industrious], honest, and excellent
as ever; but Mrs. Barrie had observed, that after the
meetings of the elders at the manse were over, David
Tait of Blackbrae took the kitchen lobby, not the front
door one, as the others did; and she also noticed, after
this had gone on for a while, that if any of the other
elders took the same road, Bell did not talk with them
so much as she used to do, but found some sudden
engagement outside the manse, and that David and she
generally re-entered the kitchen together, as soon as
the others were fairly on their way.</p>

<p>David had a small farm about a mile and a half
from Blinkbonny. His widowed mother had died lately.
He was a canny, intelligent man, in good worldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
circumstances, or, to use the Scotch phrase, “a bien
man, but very blate [diffident].”</p>

<p>Betwixt Mrs. Barrie and Bell there were no secrets,
and she often asked Bell if Mr. Tait and she were
making any progress in the way of marriage. “None
whatever,” was Bell’s general reply. “He’s a nice man
an’ a gude cracker, but he never ‘evened’ [hinted at]
marriage to me.”</p>

<p>One day Bell told Mrs. Barrie, with a gleeful face
that belied her words, “that David had met wi’ a
queer misfortune.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, Bell; what has happened? You
seem to laugh rather than lament over it,” said Mrs.
Barrie, with evident concern.</p>

<p>“Oh, mem, it’s a kind o’ laughable tae,” said Bell.
“Last Sabbath day he was takin’ a lesson on the Bible
before he cam’ to the kirk, an’ as it’s late afore he gets
hame, he was eatin’ a bit piece; it was a warm mornin’,
an’ he was sittin’ on a seat in front o’ his hoose.
Weel, ane o’ the calves got out o’ the pen, an’ he lays
down his Bible an’ his piece, an’ gangs to put in the
calf. There was a soo gaun about the close [farm-court],
an’ it snappit up David’s piece that was lying on the
Bible; and it not only took the piece, but it ate a’ the
Second Corinthians and a gude deal o’ the First. He’s
very ill about it; he’s baith vexed an’ affrontit about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<p>“It was very provoking,” said Mrs. Barrie; “the
sooner you become mistress of Blackbrae the better.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>A FRIENDLY HITCH.</i>”</div>

<p>Mrs. Barrie had hitherto spoken to Bell about
David’s attentions more in joke than in earnest, until
she knew that Mr. Barrie had decided to go to Edinburgh;
but as David’s visits were becoming more
frequent as well as longer, without seeming to come to
anything definite, she resolved to give her two worthy
friends a little help. One night, when David was in
the kitchen, Mrs. Barrie went “ben” and said, after
the usual courtesies had been exchanged: “Mr. Tait,
I see that you are going to take Bell away to Blackbrae,
reason or none, and I wish you much joy; a wife
like Bell’s a prize not to be got every day, and you
may consider yourself lucky to have won her. I’ll see
about another servant to-morrow, although I never
expect to get one as good as Bell. You must never
think about waiting till the term. Marriages break all
terms; indeed, if you both will take my advice, you
will be married <i>very</i> soon.”</p>

<p>Bell was quite unprepared for such plain speaking;
her stocking wires went very fast, and she did not
know where to look. Mrs. Barrie then turned to her
and said:</p>

<p>“Bell, get everything ready as soon as ever you can,
so that we may come once or twice to see you after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
you are fairly settled at Blackbrae, before the long
autumn nights set in.” And she added, what had never
been said by her before: “You need not come in to
worship to-night, Bell, as you two will have a very
great deal to speak about. So good night, and good
speed to you both.”</p>

<p>If they had a good deal to say, they were very long
of beginning. Bell’s wires went faster than ever—they
actually made a clicking sound; and her heart went even
faster than her wires. But David’s honest heart went
faster than either; he looked sideways, then downwards,
and fidgeted, for his</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Heart it went dunt upon dunt,</div>
    <div class="verse indentx">Till he thocht every dunt it wad crack it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At length he said, “I’m a’ sweatin’,” which was a
mild way of putting it, for he was glowing and
tingling from head to foot.</p>

<p>Bell looked fixedly, stolidly, at the stocking she
was knitting, but she uttered not a word.</p>

<p>At length David summoned courage to say:</p>

<p>“Will Mrs. Barrie really gang after anither servant
the morn, d’ye think, Bell?”</p>

<p>“She’s a woman o’ her word; she aye does what
she says.”</p>

<p>“Weel, Bell,” said David with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Weel, David,” said Bell sympathetically.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span></p>
<p>“What d’ye think, Bell?”</p>

<p>“What dae you think, David?”</p>

<p>“I dinna ken what to think.”</p>

<p>“Neither div I,” said Bell; and there was a short
pause, during which the ticking of the clock seemed
unusually loud, and both heads began to move to each
tick.</p>

<p>At length David took heart:</p>

<p>“We’re fairly in for’t noo, Bell,” said he with a
sigh; “an’ after a’, Bell, do you no’ think we micht
risk it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a very serious business, David, very; it is.”</p>

<p>“It’s a’ that, very indeed; but,” he added in his
most persuasive tone, “ye’ll no’ say no, Bell. The fac’
is, we daurna stop now, so we’ll just say it’s settl’t.”</p>

<p>“I wad need some time to think it o’er,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said David, brightening up; “quite
richt, certainly; think weel o’er’t, Bell; tak’ time,
plenty o’ time to think on’t. I’ll come doun some
other nicht afore lang. There’s luck in leisure, as the
auld sayin’ is.”</p>

<p>David’s idea of plenty of time was wider than
Bell’s. Every night for ten nights she had kept the
kitchen, if possible, brighter, and herself “redd up;”
she had also looked oftener in the looking-glass (it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
was an irregular fragment of a larger one stuck on the
facing of the window) during that time than she had
done for twelve months before, and her cap or
“mutch” was something extra even for her. As each
evening fell she looked often and wistfully up the
Blackbrae Road. After ten days had passed she felt
a little nervous, and put herself in Dan’s way, to ask
him, after some leading questions, if he had been at
Blackbrae lately. She had still to wait other three
days as best she could, but at the fortnight’s end</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The braw wooer cam’ doun the lang glen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both were “blate.” Other subjects were tried and
skimmed over, but <i>the</i> subject was not broached. Had
it not been for a noise in the lobby caused by Mrs.
Barrie’s going up-stairs, it might have lain another
fortnight or more before any progress had been made;
but fearing that she would come into the kitchen after
she came down-stairs, David blurted out hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Bell, Bell, have ye been thinkin’ on yon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Bell, with considerable modulation
of voice.</p>

<p>“An’ I do most sincerely hope ye’ll say yes,” said
David warmly; “I canna see for the life o’ me how
ever we can face Mrs. Barrie till it’s a’ settled.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>“SHE GIED HIM HER HAND,” ETC.</i></div>

<p>Bell had carefully composed what she thought a
proper answer, and during the fortnight she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
repeated it “a hunder” times to herself; but when it
was wanted it would neither come into her head nor
to her tongue. She was greatly annoyed, indeed
ashamed, at herself for this, but her honest heart and
her good sense came to her help, and guided by them
she made a far better reply than the one she had
hoarded so long and lost so suddenly; for she rose,
gave David her hand, and said:</p>

<p>“David, there’s my hand, an’ my heart gang’s wi’t;
they’re baith yours,” solemnly looking him straight in
the face. He smiled, and then of course she smiled,
and turning away her face, for she was blushing
crimson, she added: “Eh, sirs, I never wad a thocht—wha
ever wad a thocht o’ me being marrit? David,
isna the ways o’ Providence strange an’ mysterious?”</p>

<p>“’Deed ay, Bell; but arena they whiles real
pleasant tae?”</p>

<p>“Ye may say that, David, for I’ve liked ye lang,
an’ wonder’t if ever it wad come to this; an’ oh,
David, I <span class="allsmcap">CAN</span> lippen till ye perfectly wi’ a’ my heart.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to speak, Bell; that’s wiselike. I’ll
dae my vera best to make you comfortable.”</p>

<p>“So will I you, David—we’ll baith dae our best;
an’ if we hae God’s blessin’ I think we’ll dae fine.”</p>

<p>A happier couple could not be found that night than
these two, for love makes folks younger if not young.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>HA, HA, THE WOOIN’ O’T.</i>”</div>

<p>Shortly after all was settled, David hummed rather
than sung, lest he should be heard in the parlour, a
favourite song of his, which, whatever we may think
of its applicability to what we have hitherto known
as a staid, solid woman like Bell, seemed to David
“really a very bonnie sang—he was aye catchin’ himsel’
sing-singin’ at it, an’ it really was no’ far off what
he thocht himsel’;” and, strange to say, douce Bell
(although she said “stuff an’ nonsense” when he had
finished it) turned a willing ear to the song, and
nodded to herself in the looking-glass during the
singing of it. If she did not apply the whole of it to
herself, she evidently did not absolutely discard it all.</p>

description of his farm and stock, in which he was often
interrupted by Bell’s questions; very practical all of
them were, and specially gratifying to David. It was
surprising how much she got out of him in a quiet
way. But I will not tarry over the details, nor say how
long they sat, or how they parted; I will only mention
that after David had risen to leave, they stood a long
time busily talking. He had said something about
getting the house “gi’en a bit sort up,” but Bell
said:</p>

<p>“Dinna fash mickle wi’t, David; tradesfolk often
tak’ a lang time when they won in. When we get
settled, we’ll dae a’ that far better after we see what’s
what.”</p>

<p>After this night Bell seldom spoke of “<i>I</i>’ll do this,
or <i>I</i> think that,” but it was, “<i>We</i>’ll put a’ richt—<i>we</i>’ll
consider’t—<i>we</i>’ll <span class="allsmcap">MANAGE</span> ’t.”</p>

<p>She did not tell Mrs. Barrie directly of her engagement,
but it could not be hidden. Bell’s face was
itself a tell-tale, and before the next forenoon was
over she was asking Mrs. Barrie’s advice on various
subjects far removed at once from her household
concerns, and from anything likely to require her consideration
as a servant.</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THERE’S A’ THE PLEASURES O’ THE HEART.</i>”</div>

<p>Early in the afternoon Bell asked Mrs. Barrie, with
an unusual timidity, almost a sheepishness of manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
if she would be so kind as to sell her “some o’ the
black currants, noo that a’ the jam was made for the
house?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie took both Bell’s hands in hers, looked
into her face with a smile of intense delight, to the
dumfounderment [confusion] of poor Bell, who tried in
vain to restrain her grins and blushes.</p>

<p>“Bell, Bell, as you yourself often say, ‘the cat’s out
o’ the pock’—fairly out now. Allow me first to give
both hands a good shake and wish you very much joy.
I’m very, very glad for your sake, my good, kind Bell.
May all that’s good attend you and Mr. Tait. I will
have a great deal more to say to you afterwards, but
I must run and tell Mr. Barrie.”</p>

<p>“There’s somebody wi’ him in the study the noo,
mem,” said Bell; “an’ oh! if you please, dinna say
much to me about this marrying business the day.
I’m baith like to laugh and to greet about it yet, an’ I
canna find words to thank ye wi’, so excuse me.”
Then, after a short pause: “Will ye sell me the
berries, mem?”</p>

<p>“Sell, Bell? Sell to you! <i>sell</i> you what’s more
yours than mine! If I did not know you well, I
would be both vexed and angry at you, but it’s like
yourself, Bell. Please never ask me about any such
things; take them. I’ll help you all I can to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
everything ready and purpose-like. As to the black
currants, you must allow me to give you the sugar,
and be sure and fill every empty jelly-pot in the
house.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re ower kind, mem, far ower kind.”</p>

<p>“Bell,” said Mrs. Barrie, “don’t say that again, for
that is what I can never be. But there’s Mr. Barrie
disengaged now, and I must bring him in,”—which
she did, and Bell and they got it over, not without
some signs of emotion that each tried to hide, but
none were ashamed to feel, for the bond of twenty
years’ faithful service was to them a cord not easily
broken, and to Bell a retrospect of intense satisfaction;
for a vision of her life-history passed before her, which
may be summed up in the following lines:—</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE “Forms of Procedure” in the translation of
a Scottish Presbyterian minister are somewhat
elaborate, and require a good deal of time for their
various requirements of intimating, citing and hearing
parties, sustaining and transmitting the call, and
summoning the congregation to appear to answer
the reasons for translation. When the call is presented,
time is allowed for the minister’s decision;
even after this, there are other steps to be taken,
so that should the autumn season intervene, when
presbytery meetings are rarely held unless for cases of
extreme urgency, several months may elapse between
the “call” and the “settlement.”</p>

<p>It was so in Mr. Barrie’s case; but in a small place
like Blinkbonny, little things, that would in large
towns be “lost in the crowd,” are found and founded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
on to an extent much beyond their intrinsic importance.
This must be my apology for stating that
the regret at the prospect of Mr. Barrie’s leaving
was counterbalanced to a certain extent by the
announcement of Bell’s approaching marriage.</p>

<p>Under all ordinary circumstances Bell would have
been and was a “fixture,”—so much so that for years
past she had been universally called Bell Barrie, and
the idea that she ever would be married was unborn.
Hitherto the Edinburgh call had been looked at
entirely in its public aspect as affecting the Free
church of Blinkbonny, and little thought had been
expended on the private view of the matter. It was
taken for granted that the family would remove to
Edinburgh; and Bell had so long been a part of it, as
much so, in fact, as either Mr. or Mrs. Barrie, that
although she was indirectly included in the feeling of
general regret, she did not form a distinct element in
the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>GIN A BODY GREET A BODY.</i>”</div>

<p>When, therefore, it became known that she was to
be married to David Tait of Blackbrae, I may say
without exaggeration that the news was received
with heartfelt delight. All who had come much into
contact with Bell esteemed her highly, and those
who knew her best liked her most. Her unwearied
industry, her sterling worth, her kindly charity, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
humility and strong common sense, had been quietly
appreciated. Indeed, she was so unostentatious and
natural, and her good qualities were so universally
known, that they were seldom commented on.</p>

<p>Bell was surprised, and not a little annoyed, at the
number of folks who came to congratulate her on her
approaching marriage; it would have pleased her much
better had nothing been said about it.</p>

<p>“The place is like a gaun fair,” said she to David,
“mornin’, noon, an’ nicht. I canna get on wi’ my
wark for folk comin’ wishin’ me this an’ that. Nae
doubt a body likes to be likit, but no aye to be tell’d
it. Mr. Taylor said the best thing, an’ he bade nae
time; a’ he said was, ‘Gi’e me a shake o’ your hand,
Bell; I’m a wee feared ye’ll no’ escape the woe.’</p>

<p>“‘The woe!’ said I; ‘Mr. Taylor, what woe? that’s
a queer kind o’ backin’ to gi’e tae a gude wish.’</p>

<p>“‘Bell,’ said he, ‘the Bible says, “Woe unto you
when all men shall speak well of you,” an’ that’s what
a’body’s sayin’ o’ you the noo.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m maybe no’ as grateful as I should be,’ says I
‘but I wish they wadna speak about me at a’, for if
they kent me as weel as I ken mysel’, they wadna
speak as they dae; as gude auld George Brown used to
say, “The best o’ men were but men at the best,” an’
women’s just sic-like. I’ve been but an unprofitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
servant baith to God an’ man, although I think I
may say that I’ve tried to do my best.’</p>

<p>“Says he, ‘that’s the richt way to tak’ thae things,
Bell. Haud on; naebody ever stack in the world but
Lot’s wife, an’ she wad a gotten through fine, if she
had held forrit as she was well tell’t, an’ no lookit
back. There’s nothing like makin’ the shortcomin’s o’
the past warnin’s, an’ the mercies o’ the past encouragements.’”</p>

<p>“But, Bell,” said David, “wha d’ye think wished
me weel in this matter? Ye’ll never guess—there’s
mony mair forbye him, but nae less than Sir John
M<sup>c</sup>Lelland came ane’s errant to the hoose, an’ he did
gi’e you a flamin’ character. Ae thing he said was,
‘Scotland’s a grand place to dee in, for a’body speaks
weel o’ the deid; but it’s the warst place to get marrit
in, for if there’s a hair to clash about, they’ll make a
tether o’t,’—at least that was his meanin’, if no’ the
vera words,—an’ he said he wad defy mortal to say
anything but gude o’ you.”</p>

<p>“It’s because he disna ken ony better; but I’m
obleeged till him,” said Bell; “may we baith he respeckit
by richt thinkin’ kind o’ folk; we maun try
tae deserve it.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>MEASURE FOR MEASURE.</i>”</div>

<p>David continued: “Sir John tell’d me no’ an ill
story about himsel’. No lang after he was marrit, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
took his leddy to see auld Ailsie Ferguson, his henwife.
Ailsie beckit [curtsied] an’ bowed to the leddy, an’
wished her a’ that was gude; then she turned to Sir
John an’ wished him the same, sayin’ that she was
blythe to serve such a beautifu’, handsome leddy, only
she wad a likit if she had been bigger.”</p>

<p>“‘Bigger!’ said Sir John; ‘why do you wish that,
Ailsie? It seems rather a singular sort of compliment.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Sir John,’ said Ailsie, ‘they say that you got
her wecht [weight] in gold wi’ her, and of course the
bigger she was the mair ye wad hae gotten.’”</p>

<p>“Very good for Ailsie,” said Bell, “very good. Her
an’ me was weel acquaint.”</p>

<p>A movement was set afoot to give Bell a present,
and subscriptions were readily got from all classes,
irrespective of church or other distinctive connection.
There was more difficulty in determining how to
expend the money than there had been in collecting
it. Betty Kellock’s was perhaps the best proposal.</p>

<p>“Gi’e Bell the hard siller; she’ll gar’t gang farther,
and ware it better than ony o’ us.”</p>

<p>There were so many and so various proposals, that
ultimately Mrs. Barrie had to be consulted, and she
quietly sounded Bell, who would only speak on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
subject after she learned that she could not get out
of it, and the result was that a “Paisley shawl” (I
think it was also called a Paisley plaid, a “harness”
plaid) and a china tea-set were procured.</p>

<p>A meeting of lady subscribers was held in the manse
dining-room. As Dr. Stevenson insisted on being
admitted, he made the presentation, in what was reported
to me as “a real neat wee speech.” Bell’s reply
was declared by those present to have been “beautiful”;
even Miss Park said it was very becoming and most
creditable for a person in Bell’s position. The only fragment
of it that I could pick up was that “she would
not presume to invite ladies in their station to her plain
hoose, but if any o’ them would be kind enough to
come, she wad hansel the teapot wi’ a’ her heart.”
Dr. Stevenson said, “Remember, Bell, you’ll need to
give me a <i>cinder</i> in my last cup.”</p>

<p>Bell did not know that the Doctor referred to a little
whisky when he said this. She look puzzled, hospitably
puzzled, and said, “A cinder, Doctor! a cinder
in your hinmost cup? The coals are unco assy [very
ashy] hereabouts, an’ it micht break the cup; but when
a’ ither folks are served, I could drop ane into the teapot
if that would please ye.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drop it in myself, Bell, if you’ll either give me
the key of the cupboard, or put the bottle on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
table,” said the Doctor. “The cinder I mean will not
burn a cork; it’s ‘barley tea’ or ‘barley bree.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THE TONES OF THE HEART.</i>”</div>

<p>Mrs. Barrie gave Bell as her personal present a
brooch of large dimensions, which contained locks of
the hair of all the family;—wee Nellie’s was in the
middle. There was engraved on the back of the
brooch: “From Mrs. Barrie to Isabella Cameron—July
1851. ‘The Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have
dealt with the dead and with me,’ Ruth i. 8.”</p>

<p>Bell was neither romantic, nor sentimental, nor
demonstrative, but when she read the inscription, she
kissed the brooch again and again and again, and for
several nights after she got it, she often took it from
under her pillow, and pressed it to her lips and to
her heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrie’s present was a Bible in two volumes,
and he was bewildered by the number of texts he
would <i>like</i> to write on each.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said he to Mrs. Barrie, “I have spent
some hours in considering what to write on Bell’s Bible,
and have not yet decided, so many texts seem suitable.
In the first place, I would like to write the last twenty-one
verses of the Book of Proverbs. I have just been
reading these, and it seemed to me as if the writer had
Bell in his thoughts when he wrote them. It resembles
one of those new-fashioned pictures that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
taken by the sun now-a-days, called ‘daguerreotypes,’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
invented by a Frenchman called Daguerre. Could
anything more accurately descriptive of even plain
homely Bell be imagined than ‘The heart of her
husband doth safely trust in her,’—‘do him good and
not evil all the days of his life,’—‘worketh willingly
with her hands,’—‘<i>considereth</i> a field and buyeth it,’—‘reacheth
forth her hand to the needy,’—‘in her tongue
is the law of kindness,’—‘looketh well to the ways of
her household,’—‘eateth not the bread of idleness,’ and
so on, my dear,” added he, laying his hand on the
Bible. “That is an old Book,—<span class="allsmcap">THE</span> old Book,—but
its references to human life—the lower as well as the
higher life—are as applicable to the life of to-day as
they were to that of two thousand years ago. The
reading of these verses in the circumstances, and with
the object I had in view, has delighted me; I think
I never felt so irresistibly convinced that they were
written by <i>Him</i> who knew what was in man, and what
would suit mankind for all time.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The original process of photography, in which the picture was
taken on a silvered plate. The daguerreotypes required to be held in a
certain way to prevent the bright silverized plate from shining so as to
confuse the eye, and they could not be used as negatives to take other
impressions from, as photographs now are.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>FAR ABOVE RUBIES.</i>”</div>

<p>Mr. Barrie also showed her a long list of other texts:
“A succourer of many, and of myself also,”—“who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
bestowed much labour on us,”—“in labours more abundant,
in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often,”
etc. He almost grudged Mrs. Barrie her quotation from
Ruth, but he took part of the 12th verse of the second
chapter, as also the blessing of the tribes in Numbers
vi. 24–26: “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the
Lord make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious
unto thee: the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee,
and give thee peace,” and a few other passages, until
the front fly-leaf of both volumes was fairly covered.</p>

<p>Bell was immensely delighted with this gift, and
the volumes occupied in the “room” at Blackbrae the
place of honour on the small back table.</p>

<p>The very important question of the marriage gown—Bell
never got the length of a dress—was confined to
the matters of colour and fabric, as the shape was to be
her “invariable.” The dressmaker asked her if she
would like it to be low-bodied, for bare necks and
bare arms were in vogue for dress occasions at that
time.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by low-bodied?” said Bell. “D’ye
mean lang tails that ye hae to hand up for fear o’ their
trailing amang the mud? That I’ll never wear; mak’
it just like this every way.” <i>This</i> only reached to the
ankles, and was, as all her “kirk-claes” were, of douce
black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said the dressmaker, “I meant, would you
like a bare neck and sleeves? These are the fashion for
dress occasions at present.”</p>

<p>Bell looked indignantly at her, and said: “Hoo dare
you speak o’ sic heathenish fal-de-rals to me? Bare
necks and sleeves! I think I see mysel’!” But she was
quieted by the dressmaker’s gentle reply, that she was
merely inquiring, not proposing such a thing; for she
had an elderly lady to fit yesterday who would have a
“low-bodied.”</p>

<p>“There’s nae fules like auld fules, they say. Black’s
no’ lucky to get married in, so I’ve ta’en a red merino,
an’ mak’ it as ye’ve aye done my goons. An’ be sure
an’ send me the bits that’s ower—they micht come
usefu’; an’ as I’ll no’ aye hae somebody to ‘hook my
back’ where I’m gaun, pit gude big hooks an’ gude
wide eyes on’t.”</p>

<p>Dresses in those days were fastened by hooks and
eyes at the back, and many a firm “yerk” it took to
make them meet when done by the wearer alone. The
words may seem strange to younger readers, but older
householders will well remember the familiar sound of
“Hook my back.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THEY’LL HELP TO GAR THE BOATIE ROW.</i>”</div>

<p>Bell wished to postpone the marriage until the
flitting to Edinburgh was over, but Mrs. Barrie would
not hear of this; so the earliest possible day was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
fixed, Bell having determined to get Blackbrae all
right, and thereafter to see Mrs. Barrie settled in
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Bell found a “best-maid” in Mary Barrie, who was
now a handsome young lady of eighteen. Besides
having had a good education, she had the not less important
advantage of a thorough training in household
work from her mother and Bell. She was a sweet-tempered,
charming girl, and entered into the preparations
for Bell’s marriage with great spirit,—so much so
that she became Bell’s adviser or rather confidant, and
put her head, her hands, and her heart into the work.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait, the schoolmaster, whose examination
occupied part of an earlier chapter, was “best-man.”</p>

<p>James Barrie, now a promising young student,
heard Mary wondering who would give away the bride,
and he expressed to Mrs. Barrie his desire to do so;
but his mother thought he was rather young, and had
intended to ask Mr. Taylor, when another applicant
for the honour appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait, the schoolmaster, was calling on Mr.
Walker on parish business, and, as his uncle David of
Blackbrae had told him of his intended marriage, and
“trysted” him for “best-man” the day after Bell and
he had “made it up,” he was the first to give Mr.
Walker the news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>I have omitted till now to tell that Mr. Walker was
a capital player on the violin; his general instrument,
indeed, was the violoncello, “the bass fiddle”—possibly
because it was more solemn and ministerial-looking
than the “wee fiddle;” and he had few equals
in playing Scotch music of all kinds.</p>

<p>When he heard of David Tait’s approaching marriage
with Bell, he started up in an ecstasy of delight,
threw up his arms, and said:</p>

<p>“What! Bell Barrie married—David Tait married!
Bell Barrie married to David Tait—David married to
Bell! That’s news! that <i>is</i> news! It’s the best thing
I’ve heard of for many a day;” and he took a good,
hearty laugh. Then he resumed:</p>

<p>“That is <i>news</i>! He’s a decent, honest, sterling man,
your uncle—a great friend of mine” (Mr. Walker’s forte
was friendliness—his heart was larger than his head);
“a fine, a very fine man. Then Bell; Bell’s a—it beats
me to tell what Bell is. She’s the cleverest an’ best
servant in Blinkbonny; but she’s more—she’s—she’s
Bell Barrie, and that’s the pink o’ perfection for a
farmer’s wife. She’s a tocher in hersel’. Bell for a
manager—Bell for a garden, or hens, or cows, or cookin’!
Excuse me, Mr. Tait, I cannot refrain from expressing
my delight. I’ll need to try the fiddle, and see if it
will quiet me. Bell mistress o’ Blackbrae! They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
made for one another. It never struck me before, but
it’s perfection.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>BAITH MICHT AND MAIN.</i>”</div>

<p>He got the “wee” fiddle down from its peg in
the study, and marched up and down playing almost
furiously several old Scotch tunes, and occasionally
singing a line or a few words of some of them, such
as “A thrifty queen was Kate Dalrymple,” “We’re a’
gaun to the waddin’, Lassie, will ye gae?” “Hey the
bonnie! ho the bonnie! hey the bonnie breastknots!”
“Dainty Davie,” “Fy, let us a’ to the bridal,” etc.,
and he ended by playing “Auld langsyne,” with
exquisite feeling.</p>

<p>Not many days after this Mr. Walker called on
Bell, and offered to “give her away.” He was
accepted with becoming thanks, Bell declaring “that
it was far ower kind,—that she never could have
expected to hae been countenanced in the way she
had been by a’body, but really this was the crowner.”
And when all the wedding guests had met in Knowe
Park, in stalked worthy Mr. Walker, his sonsy face
beaming with delight, arm in arm with Bell, whom
he delivered with quite a “Sir Roger de Coverley”
grace by the side of David. Bell, when referring to
this memorable act of attention on Mr. Walker’s part,
used to say, “Mr. Walker oxtered me in his ainsel’,
and he was a fine buirdly man to cleek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span></p>

<p>The knot was soon tied by Mr. Barrie, “assisted
by Mr. Walker;” and Mr. Barrie, whose prerogative
it was to be the first to congratulate the happy
couple immediately at the close of the ceremony
shook hands with the young wife, and said: “Mrs.
Tait, I wish you very much happiness, and every
blessing in your married life.”</p>

<p>Bell was demure till now, and had not lifted her
eyes from the ground, but this roused her, and she
said:</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Barrie, ca’ me Bell, dinna ca’ me Mrs.
Tait,”—looking earnestly into Mr. Barrie’s face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie followed, and also said “Mrs. Tait,”
etc.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barrie,” said Bell softly and imploringly,
“if you please, mem, dinna you ca’ me Mrs. Tait.”</p>

<p>Mr. Walker was number three who called her
Mrs. Tait, and she remonstrated with him likewise:</p>

<p>“Oh, Maister Walker, Maister Walker, dinna Mrs.
Tait me—I canna thole’t.”</p>

<p>He made one of his little jokes—“To-night be
Mrs. Tait, but seeing you rebel, we will re-<i>Bell</i> you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s no’ bad,” said David. These were the first
words he had uttered since he entered the room.</p>

<div class="leftnote"><i>SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT?</i></div>

<p>A “towsie tea,” or “tea and eating,” followed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
ceremony. Mary and the schoolmaster cut up the
bridescake, and to Bell’s great delight Gordie got
the ring. Mr. Barrie made a short and happy speech,
but Bell rather broke down in the middle of it.
Mr. Walker also said a little about both David and
Bell; she brightened up as he referred to her “Black
Daisy,” and all were put into excellent humour by
his reference to “Braidnebs.”</p>

<p>When this was over, Bell, forgetting her new
position, started to collect the tea-things, and said
she would wash them up before she went away.
Mrs. Barrie did not object to Bell’s singular procedure,
but followed her to the kitchen, and after again
wishing her everything that was good, she said:</p>

<p>“Bell”—not Mrs. Tait, greatly to Bell’s delight—“I
understand that the young lads of the village
intend to give Mr. Tait and you a noisy convoy. I
think you should slip quietly away, so as to get to
Blackbrae before they assemble.”</p>

<p>This hint was taken, and the couple set off alone—not,
however, until Gordie had made David’s back
feel the weight of an old slipper with which he had
armed himself, and which he applied with all his
might.</p>

<p>Those in the manse that intended to take part
in the “home-coming” allowed about half an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
to elapse before they followed to Blackbrae, where
David’s sister and a few neighbours were surprised
to see the “happy pair” arrive earlier than they
were expected—and alone. Indeed, David and Bell,
or rather Mr. and Mrs. Tait, appeared at the “room”
door before the table was “set,” and Mrs. Brunton,
David’s sister, stood quite aghast when she saw
them.</p>

<p>“Preserve us a’,” said she, “what’s brocht ye sae
sune? I wasna lookin’ for ye for an hour yet, an’
it’ll no’ dae to come into the house without gettin’
the lucky cake broken o’er your heid, Bell. Ye’ll
need tae gang out again till the lave [rest] comes,
for I’m no’ gaun to crown ye wi’t till the best-man
an’ the best-maid’s here,—it wadna be canny [safe],
forbye [besides] it wadna be wiselike to break the
infar-cake<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> till there’s some wanters and swankies
[unmarried females and nimble young men] to
scram’le for’t; so Bell, David and you’ll just need
to gang into the garden or through the parks till the
lave comes.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

the bridegroom’s house.—<span class="smcap">Spalding.</span></p>

</div>

<p>David said: “We’ll dae nae sic things,” and Bell
said: “It was nae matter about the infar-cake, for
it was jist an auld superstition about it’s no’ bein’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>lucky no’ to hae’t richt broken, or about dreamin’

<p>But Mrs. Brunton was immoveable in this matter,
so they had to submit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>AULD LANGSYNE.</i>”</div>

<p>The time, however, was not lost: David showed
Bell the cows, the live stock, and the steading. They
had but half finished the survey of the garden when
the Knowe Park contingent came up; they joined it,
and were convoyed into the house in a style quite
to Mrs. Brunton’s mind. The infar-cake was duly
broken over Bell’s head, and the usual doggrel rhyme
repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container small">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Welcome to your ain fireside—</div>

    <div class="verse indentx">Joes are spaed by th’ infar-cake.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the young lads of the village gathered round
the manse to give David and Bell a kindly but
rough token of their respect, they were sadly disappointed
to find that they were too late. This spoiling
of their expected “ploy” [innocent frolic] irritated
them, and the more thoughtless determined to go
to Blackbrae and play some tricks on David, or, as
the ringleaders expressed it, “they wad gi’e him’t for
this.” They returned to the village to get a creel, a
fishwife’s basket, with which to “creel” David,—a
custom now unknown, but common forty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span></p>

<p>In my earlier days I have witnessed very rude
conduct when the rougher and “drouthy” neighbours
got the young husband into a creel, as soon as he
appeared outside on the day after the marriage, and
roughly jostled him until his wife came out, kissed
him, and produced the “bottle.” Whilst this custom
was dying out such extremes were not practised. The
husband got the creel put on his back, with some
weight in it (sometimes a boy, sometimes a pig, but
oftener a few stones), and the whisky was greedily
drained by the creelers to “your very good health,”
but the wife did not need to appear.</p>

<p>Dan chanced to overhear some of the more fiery
spirits concocting schemes to annoy his friends at
Blackbrae. He went home as quickly as he could,
“loosed” his ferocious, bandy-legged, ugly (not in
Dan’s eyes, for he thought him a beauty, just a
perfect picture) bull-dog “Burke,” took a short cut
through the fields, carrying with him a huge “flail”
used for threshing corn, and sat down on the
“loupin’-on stane”—a stone at the side of Blackbrae
farm-yard gate used when mounting on horseback.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>“WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK.”</i></div>

<p>Dan was leisurely smoking his black cutty-pipe,
having “Burke” on his right side, collared and
chained, the chain being wound round Dan’s arm,
and the flail lying against the wall of the farm-shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
at his left, when the Blinkbonny lads, who had
been leisurely discussing the plan of attack as they
came along, turned off the main road into the
Blackbrae farm road.</p>

<p>Rarely has a crowd looked so cowed or so cowardly
as this did when they saw Dan. He seemed provokingly
unconscious of the change of aspect that took
place when they observed him, and said in quite a
familiar, off-hand way, with the pipe still in his cheek,
“It’s a fine summer nicht for a walk this.”</p>

<p>“Burke” was not quite so neighbourly, for he
growled and oggled and strained his chain so much
that the crowd instinctively fell back.</p>

<p>Dan spoke to “Burke” very kindly. “What ails
ye, Burke? They’s a’ our ain folk, come out for a
mouthfu’ o’ fresh air. Tak’ it canny, Burke,—ye
needna carry on as if there was mischief gaun on;
they’s a’ friends o’ yours, an’ mine, an’ Blackbrae’s,
and they’re come out to wish him an’ the new
mistress weel.”</p>

<p>Some of the wilder spirits now began to chaff.</p>

<p>“When did you turn a special constable, Dan?
Ye’re the last man that ou wad ’a thocht wad ’a
spoilt the fun.”</p>

<p>“No’ me,” said Dan, “as mickle fun as ye like—tak’
yer fill o’t. Whare wad folk hae daffin’ [diversion]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
if no’ at a waddin’? Be ceevil, an’ dinna work
mischeef, an’ naebody’ll find fau’t wi’ ye.”</p>

<p>Dan wound up “Burke’s” chain, shouldered the
flail, and headed the crowd up to the front door.
David came frankly out and thanked them for the
compliment. Bell also came to the door in reply to
a call for the “mistress.” And Mrs. Brunton followed
with a bottle of whisky (pardon the truth, ye
teetotallers, for so it was wont in Blinkbonny in
those days), and said, “Come awa’, some o’ ye, an’
drink the couple’s health.”</p>

<p>None of the young men answered the invitation.
After a pause Dan stepped forward and said: “Will
ony o’ you haud ma doug, and I’ll drink their
healths?”</p>

<p>There was no reply. “Then keep quiet and dinna
cheer till I tell ye, for ‘Burke’s’ a wee roused.
I’m no’ as keen o’ a glass as I’ve seen me; I can
either tak’ it or want it.” Then taking the glass of
whisky in his hand, he said: “Here’s t’ye, Mr. Tait,
an’ here’s to the mistress,—baith your very gude
healths, an’ may a’ that’s gude befa’ you,” and
drained it at a draught.</p>

<p>“Noo,” said he, “come awa’, some mair o’ ye, an’
drink luck to Blackbrae, and after ye’re dune we’ll
gi’e them a cheer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>FROM LIVELY TO SEVERE.</i>”</div>

<p>Very few answered Dan’s invitation. When no
other could be prevailed on to do so, Dan said:
“Noo dinna cheer till I grup ‘Burke’ by the
collar; the chain micht snap.” He then wound the
chain round his arm, stooped down, and held Burke
firmly. The dog seemed to be affronted, for he
tugged, and strained, and bayed. When Dan got him
fairly in hand, he said: “Now, lads, cheer awa’; gi’e
our young friends” (here the crowd were unmannerly,
and broke out into “Oh-oh-young? ho-ho”) “a real
hearty ane.” This was done. Burke joined in the noise
if he did not help the melody, and trailed or harled
Dan a few yards nearer the crowd. David stepped
forward and again thanked them. Another cheer
followed, and all were in grand fettle, when a voice
(luckily from some unrecognisable throat at the back
of the crowd) cried out, “Three cheers for ‘Auld
Braidnebs.’”</p>

<p>“What!” said Dan sharply; “wha dared to say
that?” and he made for the flail, which he reached
with difficulty, as “Burke” seemed determined to
face the crowd. Bell saw that Dan was excited, and
laid her hand on his shoulder, intending to pacify him.</p>

<p>“For ony favour,” said he nervously, “dinna
come near me; abune a’, dinna lay hands on me,
or I’ll no’ answer for Burke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>When he turned round to ask again, “Wha said
that?” the close was empty, and the crowd was
flying pell-mell homewards—their speed not a little
quickened by Watty’s remark that “Burke was sure
to break the chain, an’ pity the man that’s hin’most.”</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Bell, “I’ve forgotten a box; ask
Jenny Bennet”—Bell’s worthy successor in Mrs.
Barrie’s kitchen—“to gie’t. It’s below the kitchen
dresser, tied up in broon paper an’ ‘skeenie’ [twine],
an’ fetch’t out wi’ ye the morn.”</p>

<p>Dan brought it, and he was so considerately
treated, that he actually took dinner in the kitchen,
a thing he had seldom done anywhere. David
convoyed him through the “close” as he was
leaving, and the sow that had vexed him so much
attracted Dan’s notice.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be needin’ me sune, Mr. Tait,” said he,
pointing to the sow; “that pig’s ready for killin’.”</p>

<p>“I canna bide it; I canna bear the sicht o’t,” said
David. “I intended it for our ain use this winter,
but since it ate the Corinthians, I wadna let a
particle o’t within ma mouth.”</p>

<p>“Ate what?” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Ye may weel say what? It ate a’ the Second
Corinthians and fully the half o’ the First.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THE CUP AND PLATTER.</i>”</div>

<p>Dan, supposing them to be some kind of new vegetable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
said, as a kind of feeler, “But she wadna eat
them a’ at ance—baith the second an’ the first?”</p>

<p>“But she did, the mair’s the pity,” said David;
“an’ it was on a Sabbath mornin’ tae, the abominable
craitur.”</p>

<p>Dan was still more at a loss to make out what
he meant, so he said inquiringly, “Some o’ the first
an’ a’ the second? She left some o’ the first crap, did
she, an’ ye planted mair, or did they grow again? or
was’t some kind o’ pushin [poison] or med’cine stuff
that didna ’gree wi’ her?”</p>

<p>“’Gree wi’ her!” said David in amazement; “’gree
wi’ her! some sort o’ medicine?—What d’ye mean?
It was the Corinthians out o’ the Bible.”</p>

<p>“Out o’ the Bible?” said Dan,—“out o’ the Bible!
I never kent that ony o’ it was for eatin’.”</p>

<p>“For eatin’?” repeated David,—“for eatin’! It
was some o’ the leaves o’ the Bible, the bit that the
Epistle to the Corinthians was printed on, that she
ate, or tore out ony way, an’ made them useless.”</p>

<p>“Was that a’?” said Dan.</p>

<p>“A’—a’—a’, Dan, was’t no’ plenty? It made me
a’ grue [shiver] to see her munchin’ them. I couldna
touch her; I canna even bring mysel’ to sell her,
for naebody that kent (and I couldna but tell) wad
eat her either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>“What for no’?” said Dan, “she’s neither ony the
waur nor ony the better o’t. If ye’ll gi’e me a gude
luckpenny, I’ll sell her for ye.”</p>

<p>David was glad to get the pig out of his premises.
Dan got a little profit by the transaction, and thus
both were pleased.</p>

<p>Bell’s “kirkin’” was a quiet affair. David and
she started early, and were seated before many folks
had come in to the church. The second volume of
Mr. Barrie’s presentation Bible was carried thither by
Bell in a clean white handkerchief and used for the
day. In her other hand she had a few sprigs of
balm and southernwood, which she moved backwards
and forwards at her nose until they were withered,
and limp, and double.</p>

<p>They dined at Knowe Park. Bell looked vexed
when Mrs. Barrie said, “You know the spare bedroom,
Bell; put off your bonnet and shawl in it, and
I daresay you’ll remember the way to the parlour.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barrie,” said Bell, “oh, dinna make a
stranger o’ me. Best bedroom!—me gang till the
best bedroom? No, no, I’ll gang to my auld room,”—which
she did; and she was heartily welcomed by
Jenny, her successor, who proved to be a revised,
I dare not say an improved, edition of Bell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A’ BODY’S BODY.</i></div>

<p>Blackbrae soon bore evidences of Bell’s presence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
The window-panes were “glancin’ clean,” David said;
“the house was lichtsomer an’ sweeter.” The part of
the “close” before the front door was railed off and
converted into a kitchen garden, and the Knowe
Park family, especially Mary and Gordie, spent
several happy afternoons at Bell’s house.</p>

<p>Many others enjoyed the homely hospitality of
Blackbrae. Dr. Stevenson, one of the hardest wrought
members of the hardest wrought class of men in
Scotland, namely, the country surgeons, often took
pot-luck there, and he never had to ask for a
“cinder,” although at the same time he was very
sparing in his use of Bell’s bottle. But he found her
so well provided with many things, little in themselves,
but invaluable to poor invalids, that he made
her his “Lady Bountiful,” and found her always not
only ready and willing, but, as Mr. Barrie expressed
it, “pre-eminently jud<i>ee</i>cious.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap-a">AS my readers are more familiar with Mrs. Tait by
her old name of Bell, it will be as well to hold
to it in what little we have to add to these “bits;” for
although she filled her new station as effectively as
she did the old one, it is rather to wind up old matters
than to enter upon new ones that she will now come
before us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>A FOUTH O’ AULD NICKNACKETS.</i>”</div>

<p>Before the actual flitting from Knowe Park took
place, Bell spent two or three busy days packing those
things that required specially careful handling; for she
was a walking inventory of all that the house contained,
and knew the history of every article in it.
An interesting volume of choice “bits” could easily
be made up from her remarks and stories about many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
of the odds-and-ends that cast up, for she not only
told the incidents with which they were associated,
but often gave a sketch of the life-history of those
they reminded her of, whilst all the time she kept
cleverly packing on.</p>

<p>Mary Barrie, who was Bell’s chief assistant in the
packing, picked up in these few days more about her
family history, and especially its connection with
some of the folks about Blinkbonny, than she had
learned during all her former lifetime. Her mother’s
marriage dress brought out a long story; even her
father’s bachelor umbrella had its share of Bell’s
comments.</p>

<p>“Bachelor umbrella?” said Mary, as she put it up;
“it’s double the size of papa’s new one—it’s quite a
family tent, and such a weight! The handle is like a
friar’s shaven crown, with a large bird’s bill sticking
out from it. And how thick the blue-black cotton is;
and bone tips to the strong whalebone ribs; and what
an elaborately embossed, sharp, tapering end it has!
It’s three times the weight of the umbrellas now-a-days.”</p>

<p>“The mair’s the pity,” said Bell; “that’s the kind
for stan’in’ a’ weathers. I often wonder that Mr.
Barrie doesna use’t yet.”</p>

<p>“Fancy papa like this!” said Mary, as she took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
the massive article under her arm and stalked about
the room.</p>

<p>“Fancy, or no’ fancy,” said Bell, “I see naething
wrang wi’t. It’s just very purpose-like; it’ll fend the
weet [defend from rain] an’ face the blast better than
the thin-shankit apologies o’ things that’s gaun noo,
wi’ their stockin’-wire ribs an’ muslin cleedin’. I
mind o’ haein’t ance when Dr. Guthrie met me in a
shower. He was glad to get into the beild o’t, an’ he
said, in his jokin’ way, ‘My good woman, that wad dae
for the roof o’ a preachin’ tent.’ But ye’ll no’ mind o’
the tent preachin’s, there’s nae sic thing noo, but
I’ve seen them langsyne in Dumbarton,—one minister
serving the tables in the kirk, an’ anither preachin’ to
the folk in the kirkyard round it. The tent was just
like a sentry-box on stilts. I’ve kent the preachin’s
gang on frae about ten in the mornin’ till nine at
nicht.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THERE’S NAE SORROW THERE, JEAN.</i>”</div>

<p>In one of the rooms Mrs. Barrie looked towards a
little drawer, and slightly nodded to Bell; she nodded
feelingly in return, but no words passed between them.
Mrs. Barrie laid a small box on a chair and left the
room; Bell opened the drawer and solemnly took out a
little beaver bonnet, a very small fur tippet, a string of
blue beads, a child’s basket rattle, and a red-and-white
wooden luggie, with a handle formed by one of its long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
staves,—when shaken, some mysteriously concealed
peas in the bottom of it rattled. It had been Nellie’s
porridge dish, and still contained a pair of little
slippers, a small copy of Watts’ hymns in scarlet
binding, and some bits of broken china with gold on
them—Nellie’s pennies.</p>

<p>These and other memorials of “Bell’s bairn”
were daintily taken out by Bell; but she was not
quite well-bred to Mary when doing this, as she
studiously turned her back on her, and kept her from
getting near the drawer. After its contents had been
beautifully packed in the little box, she closed,
wrapped, and roped it, saying, “I’ll carry you mysel’.
She’ll never need to flit—she’s hame <i>A’ways</i>.”</p>

<p>Dan came very early on the flitting morning to
help to load David’s carts, which were to take the
furniture to Edinburgh; and between the intervals of
helping on with what was carried out, he had a crack
with the horses, for he was in charge outside. Dan
was fond of all kinds of animals; horses were second
in his scale, now that he had given up game fowls.</p>

<p>“First and foremost,” he used to say, “dougs, then
horses, then goats,” and so on. In his professional
capacity as a rude veterinary surgeon, he knew the
Blackbrae teams well, and as the first cart was to be
taken in by David himself, and Bell <i>would</i> travel by it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
(although urged to take the railway, which had lately
come within four miles of Blinkbonny, and to which
the drosky was to take the family), old “Rosie” was
to lead the van. With the exception of a spot on her
forehead and one “white stocking on her far leg,”
Rosie was a coal-black, thick-set, quick-stepping,
trusty mare, a great favourite of Dan’s; and she seemed
to know it, for while he had a good deal to say, she
had abundance of leisure to listen and seemed to
enjoy the chat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>A BETTER NEVER LIFTIT LEG.</i>”</div>

<p>“Well, Rosie, my dawtie [darling],” said he, at the
same time patting her nose and kindly pulling her
ears, “ye wad need tae be in gude fettle [trim] the
day. Ye’ve a far road afore ye; but there’s nane
fitter for’t. Ye’ll no’ reist [stubbornly stick] on the
lang dreich [tiresome] Cadger’s Brae, nor on the
Ramsune [ram’s horn] Hill; for altho’ it’s no’ sae
lang as the Cadger’s Brae, it’s a nasty strauchty-squinty
[zig-zag] bit, wi’ terrible snell snabs [steep
parts] that tak’s the wind mair frae a beast than a
lang steady pu’. I ken ye o’ the auld, Rosie; ye’ll
scart [scratch] yer way up, diggin’ yer shoon intae the
road till the fire’s fleein’ frae them, an’ bendin’ yer forelegs
wi’ a’ yer pith, and strauchtin’ them back again
wi’ a nick like the spring o’ a gardener’s knife. You
for a steady day’s wark, Rosie; you’re no’ ane o’ the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
breengein’, flingin’ [rashly running, kicking] kind, Rosie;
ye just snoove [move steadily] awa’, like linseed out
o’ a pock—on an’ on—steady, steady”—and much to
the same effect.</p>

<p>As the journey was a long one, Rosie’s cart started
at a very early hour. When all was ready, Bell, as
she had to mount on the top of some mattresses which
had been put there for her comfortable journey,
handed Nellie’s box to Dan to hold, saying:</p>

<p>“Eh, Dan, that’s wee Nellie’s things in that box.
I’ll carry’t on my lap a’ the way. D’ye ken, Dan,
that your dream has hardly ever been out o’ my head
since I packit them? I aye think I see her in her
braw mansion, lookin’ doon on the confushun an’
upturn o’ the flittin’. Nae flittin’, or confushun, or
bother for her noo. Na—We maun a’ try to get
up beside her, Dan, gin the time comes.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth tryin’,” said Dan; “’deed is’t,” as Rosie,
led by David, with Bell as a deck cargo, scarcely
visible in the dark morning, started for Edinburgh.
The old mare’s long swinging step served to keep
David warm, but it actually set Bell asleep. Luckily
she was well wrapped up, so that she took no
skaith.</p>

<p>As Rosie’s cart went out, Sandie Ramage, David’s
head ploughman, appeared with the next cart, drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
by “Charlie Gray,” another of David’s plough-horses.
Dan had a good deal to say to “Charlie” also, but
Bell’s remark about Nellie’s mansion had changed the
current of his thoughts, and he spoke more to Charlie
about this matter than about the Edinburgh journey.</p>

<p>“We’ll need to try’t, as your mistress said, Charlie,”
said Dan, after exchanging civilities with the horse,
“an’ wi’ the like o’ her I get on no’ that ill; but it
disna set the like o’ me, for ye ken, Charlie, I’ve been a
wild, throughither kind o’ a man, to mak’ ony show off
or palaver about thae things; an’ forbye, what mak’s
folk sae keen to speir into a’ the oots an’ ins o’ that
kind o’ thing at the like o’ me? It’s ma business.
It’s ill kennin’ some folk, an’ there’s nae satisfyin’
ithers, an’ d’ye no’ think, Charlie, that maybe the best
o’ folk has enough adae wi’ themsel’s? Mr. Walker
says that, onyway, an’ he’s a man I can speak till.
We’ve haen mony a crack, an’ I’ve aye been the better
o’t; he’s that hamely an’ kindlike, an’ firm tae. He
tak’s pains tae mak’ the thing plain, an’ he doesna
miss ye if ye’re in faut; he grups ye gey sharp, an’
gars [makes] ye a’ shiver if ye’ve been misbehavin’.”</p>

<p>Finding Charlie a patient listener, Dan went on as
leisure admitted; but it would be tedious to record all
he said. One bit was spoken rather louder than the
rest, and reported to me as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

speakin’ about them; but I tak’ very ill wi’ the like o’
Miss Park speirin’ [inquiring] if I’ve fand this, or am
sure o’ that; an’ after gaun ower about a dizzen o’ lang-nebbit
dictionar’ words, she tell’d me if I couldna say
I had them an’ ither evidences, as she ca’d them, I was
deid an’ something.—An’ what business had she to
say that nae gude man could keep a big ugly doug—meanin’
my Burke? He’s a hantle better-lookin’ than
her, wi’ her wizened leathery chafts [jaws]. I’ve never
letten him fecht, or gaen to see either cock-fechts or
doug-fechts, since I saw the pictures. Burke an’ me’s
ower auld friends to pairt noo; in fac’, Charlie, I learn
mair frae him than the like o’ Miss Park. I whiles
dae up her bit garden, an’ she speaks that saucy an’
disdainfu’-like at me, as if I was some nasty mongrel.
She minds me o’ the doctors at Greenock lang syne,
that used to boord the ships if there was onybody no’
weel in them. They were the sharp blades. They
never even offert to gang near the puir sailors to cure
them, or help them onyway; it was just, ‘Bad case;
off to hospital—off too—off,’ an’ sic like. Nae doubt
she means to dae me gude, but yon’s no’ the way! It’s
like as Burke used to be amang the sheep whiles when
I was gi’ein’ him a walk lang syne; it was a kind o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
vexin’ sicht, for Burke wasna <i>exactly</i> like a collie
amang them.”</p>

<p>After all the carts were laden, Dan waited to convoy
the last one for a few miles on the road. Mrs. Barrie
called him in, and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Dan, I’m not going to pay you in money for
this morning’s work.”</p>

<p>“Pay me!” said Dan; “pay <i>me</i> in money! Ye ken
better than to vex me that sair. I couldna even look
Burke in the face if I took a farden [farthing]. He
wad be that affrontit at me that he wadna gi’e me
house-room.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of offering you money, Dan,”
replied Mrs. Barrie. “I am quite pleased to accept
your help as a friend of the family; but to keep you
from forgetting us altogether”—</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll never dae,” said Dan very firmly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie bowed neatly, and proceeded in a
homelier tone than before: “To keep you in mind of us
all, I ask you to take this picture, and hang it in your
house; it’s your old friend, ‘The Angel’s Whisper.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>THERE’S A DEEP LORE IN HEARTS OF LOVE.</i>”</div>

<p>The picture-frame was leaning against the dining-room
wall, and only its rough brown paper back was
visible until Mrs. Barrie had named it. She then
lifted it up and turned its face towards Dan. The
poor man started, applied first the cuff of his coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
then his rough woollen cap, to his eyes; and, as he
afterwards told Bell, “I fand out where my heart was,
sure eneuch; it flappert about like a fresh-run sea-troot
wi’ a hook in its mooth. I was that gliffed
[taken by surprise] that I couldna even say Thank ye.”
Mrs. Barrie had great difficulty in getting him to take
the picture.</p>

<p>“Take that,—that frae you! that’s the brawest
thing in yer hoose. That’s no’ like ma house at a’.
It’s far ower splendid—it’s just awfu’ bonnie; that’s a
pictur’ an’ no mistake,” said Dan; and he kept gazing
at it until his solitary eye watered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie would take no denial. She advised
Dan to take it home at once; and, shaking him by
the hand, she said: “Good-bye, Dan; many thanks for
all your kindness. Be sure if ever you are in Edinburgh
to come and see us.”</p>

<p>Dan’s eye followed her as she left the room with a
funny smile on it; and he said to himself:</p>

<p>“Me come to see ye—<i>me</i>! That wad be a farce.
I think the offishers [police] wad keep a gey sharp
look-out for some nichts after they saw me at siccan
a house.” Here he was interrupted by hearing Sandie
Ramage saying, “I’ll tak’ a bit draw, an’ then start.”</p>

<p>Dan quickly crossed the field with his precious
burden, taking great care to keep the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
picture uppermost, and not to shake it. Sandie
Ramage said he heard him say, “If I’m no’ carefu’, I
micht wauken the bonnie bairn.” After he got it
safely home, and put, still top uppermost, inside of his
box bed, he put the only two chairs he had in the
house before it, locked the door, and convoyed Charlie
Gray until he had mastered the “Ramsune Hill,”
assisted by Dan from the back of the cart at the zig-zag
turns. He would have gone farther, but he was
wearying to have a good look at the picture. On
his way home he met the drosky containing Mrs.
Barrie and the children. Gordie, who was beside the
driver, cried to those inside, “Here’s Dan coming!”
As they passed, all waved him a kind good-bye, and
poor Dan stood, cap in hand, looking at the receding
vehicle until Gordie turned round and waved his cap.
Dan did the same, and said laughingly, “Ye’re an
awfu’ ane. He’s a stuffy laddie that,—he’ll no’ let
grass grow at his heels. But they’re a’ gude thegither,
an’ they hae been gude to me. Ma blessings may be
no’ muckle worth, but they hae’t frae my heart,—God
bless them a’.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BETTER FLEECH A FOOL THAN FECHT HIM.</i></div>

<p>When he reached his own door he found Mr.
Walker there. He had been at the London Exhibition
of 1851, and had got from a publisher, an old
Blinkbonny man, some copies of the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
one of which he had brought to Dan, who was so
proud of his new picture that he asked Mr. Walker
in to see it. Mr. Walker explained to him some of
the pictures in the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, which greatly
interested him. A neighbour’s boy occasionally came
in and read it to him, greatly to Dan’s delight. Had
I room to give his comments, they would astonish even
very learned men; but I must take leave of Dan for
the present, and am glad to leave him such a quiet
neighbourly man, that when an impertinent fellow
shortly after this called “Braidnebs” after him, Dan
quietly looked at him and said:</p>

<p>“If I was as I’ve seen me, I wad ’a made a fule o’
mysel’ the noo; an’ ye’re trying to mak’ a fule o’ me,
but ye’ll find out that ye’re jist makin’ a fule o’ yersel’.
The game’s here yet, but it disna show up at a dirty
barn-door bantin’ that kens nae better. Man, I’m
sorry for ye.”</p>

<p>The flitting got all right to Edinburgh. Bell had
not been there before, and was greatly taken with the
Castle. “It was bigger and had mair houses on’t than
Dumbarton Castle; but there was ae thing, it hadna
the bonnie Clyde round it.” When she arrived at
the house she set to work at once, William Morrison,
the singing deacon formerly mentioned, who had charge
of the flitting, having come off with the early train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>“Weel, Willie, is the house a’ ready? Is a’ the
lums soopit [chimneys swept]? It’s a bit nice-like
house. Has May Ritchie gotten’t a’ clean?”</p>

<p>Here May, Guy’s daughter, appeared to answer for
herself.</p>

<p>“A’s as clean as a new preen [pin],” said
May.</p>

<p>Bell was now inside, and evidently had not the
same high estimate of the cleanness of the house as
May had.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said she as she sniffed about. “May,
it’s hardly just that; it’s rather like the ‘Willie
Cossar’ (an old name for a large-sized pin) that Dan
used to pick his pipe wi’, an’ hit was very dim,—yellow,
green, an’ a’ colours. But I’ll gi’e a bit hand,
an’ we’ll sune take out what’s left,—the feck [most]
o’t’s out, onyway;” and Bell soon put a new face on
the parts that needed attention.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrie wished her to stay over the Sabbath,
and to be present at the introduction of Mr. Barrie
to his new charge, but Bell did not relish that idea
at all. Although the call had helped on her marriage,
it had parted her from her best friends; and she said
to David, that “altho’ there was naebody she likit sae
weel to hear as Mr. Barrie, she wad Wishart-Kirk
nane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>MAK’ ILKA THING LOOK BRAW.</i>”</div>

<p>After getting things “a wee snod” in the new
house, she fulfilled her early promise to David to put
everything right by making a good many very sensible
purchases for Blackbrae. Not even an Edinburgh
shopkeeper could induce Bell to buy, hardly even to
look at, anything she did not think needful;—she had
matured her inventory of wants, and held to it. She
quickly scented that she was wrong if she went into
a “cheap John” shop, as she called it; and, when
outside, said to David:</p>

<p>“It’s hard for a greedy e’e to hae a leal heart:
we’ll hae nae trash in our house—a’s no’ gold that
glitters.” The result of her shopping was: “I dinna
ken whether M<sup>c</sup>Laren or Lauther’s the best shop, but
there’s this much, they hae gude things; an’ if ye’re
willing to pay for them, ye’ll get the very best, an’
hit’s aye the cheapest.”</p>

<p>Bell and David had resolved to furnish one or two
of the rooms, so that she could invite her old friends
to stay with her. “She thocht they wad like to come,
an’ she wad be as glad to see them, specially Gordie,
but ’deed ony o’ them a’.” Sandie Ramage got all the
shoppings gathered together, and after bidding good-bye
to Mrs. Barrie’s household, they “drove the day
into the night,” and landed safely at Blackbrae.</p>

<p>There they were “as happy as the day was lang,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Bell doing her part as thoroughly as she had ever done
it in Mrs. Barrie’s service, but with even more pawkiness
[shrewdness] than ever; and she carried on her
experiments with her hens,—indeed, with all the live
stock,—until, to them, “her very foot had music in’t”
as she went amongst them. And David and she had
as cosy a fireside as could be found in broad Scotland,
until for miles round, the best recommendation that a
servant could have was that she had been a year or
two at Blackbrae when she was a lassie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<i>SCOTCH REVIEWER.</i>”</div>

<p>Many acts of considerate kindness are told by the
poor and the needy about the mistress at Blackbrae;
for Bell’s heart expanded as her power of doing good
increased. She had little romantic poetry in her
nature, for her favourite book in that way was the
admirable collection of nursery songs that first
appeared at the end of a book called “Whistle-binkie,”
which is unhappily now very scarce. Bell
had the “Songs for the Nursery” bound separately,
and many a night did she entertain the Barrie bairns
with its admirable Doric: “Willie Winkie,” “Cockie-Leerie-La,”
“John Frost,” “The A B C,” “Uncle
Jamie,” “Cur-rook-i-ty-doo,” etc.; but she always
ended with “The Blind Beggar Man,” and to this day
she carries out the noble sentiments embodied in the
following lines:—</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before putting these “Bits from Blinkbonny” into
the hands of the public, I asked Mr. Andrew Taylor,
my old friend the precentor already referred to, to
look over them; for old Mr. Taylor, and worthy Mr.
Morrison the minister, and Miss Park, and many of
those who are mentioned in the “Bits,” have passed
away.</p>

<p>His criticism was: “Well, I’ve read your ‘Bits,’
an’ they’re no’ bad, considerin’. Ye’ve said rather
much about the Free Kirk an’ Bell; for although she’s
a nice body, she’s just like oursel’s, an’ no’ the kind to
make a book o’. An’ then Dan was a queer subject
to mix up wi’ the ithers. It’s a’ true enough so far.
I mind o’ the braid-nebs an’ the dream, an’ David
himsel’ tell’d me about the sow an’ the Corinthians.
The whole affair brings me in mind o’ a fire-screen my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
daughter won at a bazaar; it’s covered wi’ pictures o’
a’ sorts an’ sizes, wi’ scenes out o’ every country under
the sun, an’ at a’ times o’ the year, simmer an’ winter;
there’s butterflies bigger than folk, an’ oranges and
peaches, and even shells, growin’ on ivy leaves. In
fact, it minds me o’ a story in Dean Ramsay’s book
about a Scotchman when he was askit by an Englishman
if he ca’d a sheep’s head a dish? ‘I dinna
ken,’ said Sawnie, ‘but there’s a lot o’ gude confused
eatin’ about it, onyway.’”</p>

<p>I told him that I felt it was more of a hash than a
joint, a sort of literary haggis, but that it was difficult
to give a fair notion of village life without bringing in
all sorts of folks and scenes.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I’m sayin’,” said Andrew.
“There’s the ither kirks, as gude as the Free, that ye’ve
said little about; an’ then there’s our tradesmen,—there
were some queer fish among them in my young
days; an’ there’s the schule, an’ the doctor, an’ plenty
mair. Could ye no’ hae said something about the like
o’ the generality o’ the auld folk o’ Blinkbonny? If
ye tak’ as lang to them as ye’ve ta’en to Bell, ye micht
make fifty books.”</p>

<p>I acknowledged the correctness of his remarks, and
advised him to try it himself, and he would perhaps
find it more difficult than he imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p>“Me write a book!” said he; “I’ve mair sense.
You’ll find that you’re sure to hae trampit on somebody’s
tender corns.”</p>

<div class="leftnote">“<i>THE HANGING COMMITTEE.</i>”</div>

<p>“Very likely,” said I, “but if so, it has been quite
unintentional on my part. I had no plan before me
when I started, nor have I, whilst trying to reproduce
bygone times, had any object in view but to present
them in a friendly spirit and in a homely garb.”</p>

<p>I hope that my readers will receive in the same
spirit these “Bits from Blinkbonny.”</p>
